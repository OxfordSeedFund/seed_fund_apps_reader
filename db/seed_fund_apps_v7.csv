Complimentary just launched for iPhone, and allows users to send compliments to friends in the Facebook network. It also allows users to view compliments and positive messages being shared near their geographic location. The app actively encourages positive communication and sharing to create a network marked by positivity.","Our idea is simple: social media is extremely popular, but too often is filled with cyberbullying, which most users do not want. For this reason, a social media platform both dedicated to combating cyberbulling and to creating a space for sharing kindness and positivity should strongly appeal to an enormous set of users.Despite their success, these apps are heavily stigmatized for offering platforms too easily conducive to cyberbullying. Nominally few gains have been made in developing platforms committed to social sharing that actively discourage and combat cyberbullying, in spite of the fact that the majority of social media users are actively against cyberbullying, Cyberbullying is the nontheless pervasive and more-or-less authorized by anonymous messaging, leading to strikingly bleak outcomes. Over 50% of young people report being cyberbullied. One in ten students as young as middle school age have been subjected to hate speech via social media. 95% of teens who witness other being cyberbullying report doing nothing to report it. As a result, social media self-perpetuates cyberbullying by giving users platforms for anonymous attacks where bullying goes unchecked (http://nobullying.com/cyber-bullying-statistics-2014/) However, these troubling statistics provide a significant insight into an untapped social media market: Given that the majority of social media users aim to avoid cyberbullies and refrain from cyberbullying themselves, an app actively committed to promoting positive communication and the avoidance of cyberbullying would be expected to gain greater traction among users than unrestricted anonymous messaging platforms like Yik Yak and Snapchat if it is also marketed in such a way that appeals to the same pool of users. Complimentary has been in development since December of 2014 and launched November 2015.","Complimentary's beta testing pilot, comprised of approximately thirty users, generated hundreds of compliments in a five-day period as well as thousands of app requests per day. Complimentary was just released for a public soft launch, in which we plan to grow the app actively in three locations: Silicon Valley, Oxford, UK, and Seattle, Washington. Each of these areas have demonstrable histories of rapid app growth and will provide key metrics about our primary audience of users.   (http://www.ncpc.org/resources/files/pdf/bullying/cyberbullying.pdf)","Anonymous messaging apps have tapped into a market worth upwards of 100 million pounds, with top-performing apps like Snapchat drawing 100 million daily users sharing nearly 10,000 photos per second. Technically simple messaging apps like Yik Yak and Whisper have attained valuations exceeding $200 million within only one year on the market.","At this moment, Complimentary is entirely free for users. Future routes to monetization could include ads and in-app purchases. Presently, Complimentary plans to remain ad-free, following the models of other successful social networking startups like Facebook, Twitter, Yik Yak, Snapchat, and Whisper which achieved extremely successful launches and first years in part because they offered free services to users. Collecting user data for targeted ads, as well as growing a large user base, will provide future opportunities for growth and monetization. These efforts, however, will need to be counterbalanced with Complimentary's commitment to privacy, secure communication, and the protection of anonymized user information. For this reason, our primary monetization approach will be ads and in-app purchases. As noted previously, the market for anonymous messaging apps is extremely healthy, with financial projections almost unanimously predicting extremely high levels of growth for mobile messaging apps (exceeding predictions for traditional social media). ","20,000 GBPFunding will be used for 1) technical updates 2) marketing and promotion. Complimentary needs initial momentum to catalyze rapid growth. The launch has already been successful, but to make Complimentary a truly competitive messaging app, we need funding to promote the app and target and recruit new users. Funding from the Seed Fund will take Complimentary to the next level, at which it is competitive with similar real-time messaging apps and capable of disrupting the current social media space.","1) Raise 35,000 GBP to grow Complimentary2) Acquire at least 50,000 users in three distinct geographic locations3) Respond to and release technical updates drawing on user feedback and satisfaction4) Expand our team to include team members dedicated to marketing and development","Complimentary competes with anonymous messaging apps like Yik Yak, Snapchat, and Whisper, but it should be distinguished from messaging apps like WhatsApp and iMessage, which fall into the category of text/sms-like apps. Complimentary offers a product distinct enough from Yik Yak, Snapchat, and Whisper (and in some manner directly opposed to these apps) that it should be able to both capture users of these apps and generate new pools of users aiming to avoid cyberbulling and negative effects from these apps. Direct competition from positive/anti-bullying social media apps is virtually nonexistent. The social messaging app Kindr allowed users to share compliments with others, but it is now virtually defunct. At the time of its launch, it generated publicity in Huffington Post and in a variety of outlets and gained users rapidly. The app ceased operations primarily because the founder shifted attention to a new project. Otherwise, positive social media remains an unexplored market primed for growth, and Complimentary's performance so far indicates that it is more than ready to take on the challenge in a market that could offer unprecedented growth.Given that the majority of social media users aim to avoid cyberbullies and refrain from cyberbullying themselves, we predict that Complimentary can gain greater traction among users than unrestricted anonymous messaging platforms like Yik Yak and Snapchat. Complimentary is an anonymous messaging app that leverages the unprecedented social connectivity rendered possible by social media for spreading positivity and kindness.The app also encourages users to intervene in stopping users from engaging in cyberbullying. Unlike Yik Yak and virtually all other anonymous apps, it allows users to instantly block abusive users from communicating with them. This is a data-driven decision drawn from the fact that 70% of adolescents and young adults report that blocking users is the most effective method they have used for combating instances of cyberbullying.",None,SaŒ«d Business School website,12/07/2015 - 08:27,86.172.57.149,Nick Housby,nicholas.housby@sbs.ox.ac.uk,7949244120,Co-founder,No,"I am currently spending at least two days per week on fundraising.The CEO, James Sharpe, will go full time when we complete our first fund-raise and I will go part time as executive Chairman.","The management team is strong _ Nick Housby has been involved as a founder and NED/advisor for several spin out companies and is the executive chairman of BioMimOx.

The main challenges of the biopharmaceutical industry are 1.	To increase the efficiency and 2.	Reduce the costs of the manufacturing process, with respect to the protein recovery, purity and efficacy. Downstream processing technologies associated with the protein therapeutics market make up around 80% of the total manufacturing costs of therapeutic proteins.  In fact, the cost of Protein A for mAb purification accounts for 35% of the total raw material costs for downstream processing.  Protein A resins cost around $12,000 - $15,000/litre, for a 10,000 litre batch of cell slurry, 10,000 litres of Protein A resin is required - $120-150 Million!  The resins can be regenerated and reused a limited number of times before the binding capacity drops off and the process becomes unacceptable for purification.  There are alternatives to Protein A, such as Protein G and Protein L (both similar to Protein A in their structure and function), which are slightly less expensive but suffer from a lower performance in terms of capacity and re-usability.  ","BioMimOx Ltd will adopt the following criteria into our business model and strategy.  The Directors believe this to be the most focussed approach delivering increasing capability in a managed and scalable manner.BioMimOx has proprietary technology with which it aims to exploit in a licensing and partnering business model. This is the simplest form of commercialisation for the Company which will lead to early revenue generation and profitability within a three year period. The company does not wish to seek to develop pharmaceutical drugs but to partner with existing players to develop early relationships with large pharmaceutical companies and smaller research SMEs. The key will be to get involvement at the earliest possible part of the drug development process in order to í¿lock iníç the BioMimOx technology. Regulatory bodies require that the drug submissions for development include tightly monitored processes. To get the technology locked in early means that a change to the protocol is difficult to achieve. ","BioMimOx are seeking Œ£300,000 of equity funding in return for a 25% equity stake.  We realise that the seed fund will invest up to Œ£25,000 which is nowhere near our target but, currently the company is in need for some funds to provide essential cash flow whilst we are completing our funding round.

It will facilitate diagnosis, monitoring, and prediction of gastrointestinal disorders, which are on the rise worldwide. Our pill-sized ingestible capsule, called Micropearl, will collect intestinal contents (including microbiome and metabolites) in a targeted manner with minimal inconvenience to users. Following retrieval, the sample can be easily extracted and analysed for downstream processing in a range of healthcare applications and microbiome research. It will, thus, provide an uncompromising alternative to currently available methods, such as endoscopy and faecal swabs, which represent a trade-off between accuracy and cost. ","BioMe Oxford Ltd was founded in May 2015; however, the team has worked on the development of Micropearl for 15 months. An unmet need for a more effective gut-sampling tool was first recognised by our CSO, Agnieszka Chomka, through her scientific work as an intestinal immunologist. The team has expertise in science, data analysis, business management, and finance, providing necessary skills to make our business venture successful.

Based on the initial designs, we have since been working with the Medical Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC), part of the Innovate UK catapult services. Together with their engineers, we finalised a prototype design, identified manufacturing strategies and suppliers of key components. To decrease technical risk we have incorporated modularity into the choice of materials for each feature of the device as an integral part of the final design. The described work was funded by the winnings from business competitions and an Innovate UK voucher. We are currently engaging with investors and seeking non-dilutive grants to fund prototype development.","Insights generated through our market survey among gastroenterologists, and KOL interviews, allowed us to identify two key markets. First, we target the clinical research market within the pharmaceutical industry and academia. Projections based on the number of performed microbiome-related clinical trials indicate that we will capture 25% of the research market estimated at Œ£4 million in 2018. During the second phase of our business model, we aim to target the multibillion-dollar healthcare market with private and public healthcare providers as primary customers. We currently operate as a virtual company and plan to outsource aspects of marketing, e.g. distribution of Micropearl. This will allow us to leverage the expertise of companies with mature product distribution channels in the US and Europe. ","Once the development of our prototype and a safety study (primo 2017) are completed, we will approach the clinical research community to establish partnerships, providing Micropearl at a discounted price, with data-sharing agreements for further product development.Based on conservative financial projections, we will be able to generate early revenue while continuously improving our product and establishing clinical utility; the clinical research market alone will ensure a positive NPV for our company. The results of our previously conducted market survey showed a strong demand for a device like ours, with half the customer segment willing to pay up to Œ£50 per device, though manufacturing costs have been estimated to be less than Œ£3 per unit.","We are seeking Œ£25k from Seed Fund, which we require to reach the next milestones of prototype development through a partnership with engineers at the AMRC.

The latter will be critical for optimisation, demonstration of proof of principle, and patent applications to further de-risk our company for future investment. We are currently applying for an Innovate UK Smart 2015/16 grant, and proceeds from the Seed Fund can be leveraged to match funding for even a greater impact.","Prototype development, prototype testing, and patent application are the key milestones in 2016. Prototype development will be completed in partnership with engineers at the AMRC within 6 months once we secure funding. We will then test the prototype functionality in the following 6 months. We are currently in final discussions with an industry partner to secure lab space and in vitro systems that will allow us for a time-efficient testing phase. This will sufficiently de-risk the company to seek further investment for the human clinical trial to confirm safety. Additionally, in months 1-3, we are going to submit a patent application based on the IP strategy currently discussed with patent attorneys.","At present, faecal swabs and endoscopy are the main competitors.

We have set up Google AdWords and the response has been positive; we are in the process of discussion with potential customer Swiss Life, one of the largest insurance companies in Europe. The size of the market is approximately Œ£2bn per year, which is the total advertising spend on life insurance in the UK. Out of this Œ£2bn, ca Œ£200m is spent online, and we can expect this portion to grow significantly in the future. ","We are already making money by finding clients at a much lower cost than what our clients are willing to pay. If we can scale up and own the full sales funnel of life insurance, we will be able to source clients at a total conversion cost of Œ£200, while insurance companies currently pay Œ£2000. We can capture a big portion of this increased cost efficiency, for example by taking a commission on every sale of life insurance we enable. In the long term, we could even apply the same model to other financial products, as there will always be more efficiencies to be gained from digital advertising powered by predictive analytics.  ","We are seeking Œ£20k which will last us until the summer, at which point we will raise angel investment. We will use it to scale up our existing ads that run on Facebook, build our first platform product and fund the acquisition of our first major insurance client. Part of the money will also be needed for the administrative costs of setting up the business, registering a limited company, setting up a virtual office address etc. The Œ£20k are instrumental in getting us from a proof-of-concept stage where we are now, to a standalone company ready to fundraise.

","Ingram Faraday was founded at the end of 2015, after two years of development and refinement. The idea arose after Ovais, a neuropsychiatrist at the time, met Neil, an ex-F1 race engineer, and they talked. Are there ways to assess and make a faster driver, using findings from neuroscience and psychiatry? Ovais spent time embedded in the race team, interviewing drivers, engineers, technicians, and then deployed spent a few races deploying these techniques, with great effect. It turned out that pro drivers, on average, only felt they were driving at their personal best around 30% of the time. In a world where milliseconds are important, it seemed strange that while every other part of the car was meant to run at 99%+, there was little science applied to the driver directly. Most drivers are left to figure out their own styles of how to develop the cognitive tools to increase competitiveness, handle opponents, manage risk, etc. Domains such as attention duration, visuo-spatial awareness, risk computation, and cognitive modelling, are all thing that traditional medicine does. What if the same techniques are applied to high-functioning people, to enhance their skills further? . Our partnership and passions are unique.

This work helped them refine their methods, keep focus, and perform more smoothly. Ovais left his post as a neuropsychiatrist in early 2015.

Compared to any other industry, professional motorsport has one of the highest R&D expenditures -running as high as 50% in Formula One. The absolute amounts that these entities spend on getting the competitive edge are huge. To give some examples:- In GP2, a team needs around Œ£2m per annum just to fund a  driver. -  Nico Rosberg (F1) earns Œ£14m per year, but per second of lap time improvement, he is still very cheap compared to getting the same improvement from an engine. ","The programme's benefits are hinged on a simple, manifest principle with high face value, such that it is almost impossible to ignore the urgent niche that the business uniquely occupies. In 20 seconds or less:Professional drivers report that they drive at their best, on average, only about 30%  of the time (n=18, Silverstone, Sep 2014). If an engineer made a moving part or ECU that only performed to spec 30% of the time, this would be unacceptable. Why has this been allowed to go on for the most important ECU of all- the driver? Neil and Ovais both assess and interprets team and driver technical issues, and present them to  each other. Together, the cognitive/scientific elements are extracted, targetted and translated into workable schemas for driver improvement. Programmes are invoiced for one year, up front, with a contingency payment due if the agreed outcomes are reached.  The programme is modular, each domain costing a base price of Œ£24,000.

On the other hand, a student can be backed by 7-9 mentors keen on monitoring their investments now and mentor with an impact. Nobody in the market links lending with mentoring. The platform gives also the possibility to the University to guarantee some unsecured loan in order to attract more lenders.","This summer Lucas attempted to swim the English Channel to support an Indian school and raised more than EUR 25k (had to stop after 14 hours and 70% of the distance covered!). During the campaign he suggested the charity start thinking about lending to students instead of donating. Soon thereafter, Lucas came up with the TRUSTed idea during a Startup Weekend in Luxembourg. Lucas has decided to start a company to help the very best students access world-class education. He can address the problem because he himself has to repay an MBA loan, belongs to several Alumni Associations, and is a philanthropist for education causes.

We have also incorporated a company in Oxford and approached the FCA. Most of us have participated in several FinTech conferences, discussed the idea with family, friends, and professionals. The idea has received much positive feedback so far. We are currently working on the prototype and aim to finalize the MVP soon afterwards. ","We aim our customer base to be top Business Schools and Universities with strong Alumni Communities. By Q2 2017, TRUSTed plans to contact 250 schools (indirectly 1m students and 25m alumni). We estimate there are 30% international students, 30% of those may be in need of a loan, on average, USD 25k (Institute of Education Science, US, and British Council, UK). We base our business plan on a conservative estimate of 0.1% penetration of this market in 2016, 1% in 2017 (similar market penetration as Prodigy Finance) and 5% in 2018. The focus is on the international student debt market in both US and UK, in general, represented by students from China and India (UNESCO Education). ","We will make money from origination fees (1% to 2% of the loan balance) and servicing fees (1% of the outstanding loan balance). The pricing strategy for 2016 is to penetrate the market quickly with a low price, starting with 1% origination fees. From 2017 we may start charging origination fees of up to 2%, and an interest rate margin of up to 1%. Depending on the number of students and alumni joining the platform and the average size of the loan, this revenue model could allow us to be profitable from 2017 (financial model available upon request).","If the Seed Fund provides GBP 25k, TRUSTed will put GBP 125k of its own in 5 tranches by Q1 2017.

We have built our own cloud data management system tailored for the WSN application. Furthermore, we add energy-harvesting features at the sensor nodes to complement the power supply, which eliminates power disruption to the nodes and increase reliability. We have a diagnostic tool that allows the user to diagnose network coverage in remote areas and detect network bottlenecks based on wireless traffic.

Currently we have a second prototype, and a final product will be ready in Spring 2016 for field-testing at a customeríçs site. We have started work to integrate a new communication protocol that uses less power than the current dominant protocol in smart grid monitoring systems. We have achieved an average power consumption of 1mA or lower, and a loss tolerance of 2% only. We calculated that a grid operator could save Œ£1,000,000 per year per 100km of 500 kV cables using our system. Our current funds are raised from the founders and have yet to receive investment from external sources.","Ubisor aspires to provide WSN technology for a connected smart city, with applications ranging from smart grid, transportation to infrastructure health-monitoring. We have already established agreements with grid operators for field-tests and collaborations in product development.

Cyclists no longer have to worry about getting lost or distracted on busy roads or have to retrieve their phone - a quick glance to Blubel on the handlebars will show the next turn and the direction of the final destination. Powered by its smartphone app, Blubel learns from other cyclists and suggests the fastest, safest and easiest routes. Blubel detects when the cyclist dings the bell in case of dangers such as roadworks, which routes the cyclist prefers and other data to improve its route calculation for the rest of the community. Think bicycle bell with Waze-like social navigation.","Cycling in London made me realise how much knowledge cyclists have about their known routes, and currently there is no easy way to share this information across the community, particularly in real time. The initial idea was to create an app that crowdsources routes and danger points, such as potholes, busy junctions, roadworks and other potential issues. I met Alessio in mid 2014 and we started prototyping. After testing the app we realised that another issue is phones are unsafe to use on the go. So we started working on the Blubel device in March 2015 to make an intuitive navigation interface for cyclists with easy data feedback mechanism for the community.","1) iOS and Android apps as per video illustrating the Blubel concept (https://goo.gl/pTzGg0). We will add additional features, however it is ready for launch as is.2) Built the hardware prototype (initially from Arduino components, and then through a bespoke board) and tested with users to refine navigation.3) Final product design: with funding from InnovateUK, we worked with a product team to design Blubel. We refined the bell attachment and other design elements with an industrial designer,  tested the design with several cyclists and conducted focus groups to refine functionality and features.4) Branding and marketing: we launched website and social media to build brand awareness, and are working with a PR freelancer to prepare the launch campaign.","We will reach cyclists through partnerships with major cycling accessories distributors and retailers (Wiggle, Halfords, Evans Cycles), gift stores and online retailers (such as Amazon). In addition we will partner with cycle hire schemes such as Santender bikes in London. We will also sell through own website generating higher margins. Cyclists purchasing new bikes: 3.6m bicycles were sold in the UK.

Taking into account Europe and the US - where total number of new bikes sold is 20m and 18m per year respectively, assuming a conservative 5% market penetration, this would generate revenues of Œ£133m.","Sales of the Blubel device will be the primary source of revenues - currently estimate the price to be at Œ£60-70, with wholesale price of Œ£30-35. In addition, we will generate revenues through in-app purchases of the smartphone app. For instance, sales of curated cycling leisure rides for tourists visiting new cities by bike or fitness training guides. Other revenues would come from packaging the data for local authorities to improve transport infrastructure. For example, we would advise the local councils on where cyclists have noted dangerous areas to improve the cycling facilities.","Œ£25,000 to develop the product from the current prototype to market launch via a crowdfunding campaign. 1) Develop the final design of the device to manufacture-ready (including materials and production methods).

","Hussain: https://uk.linkedin.com/in/hussain-rashid-67a38a16Kira: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kcallmann",Current University of Oxford postgraduate,,Humanities,,Taaruf,Taaruf.com (under development),"Taaruf will be an online platform to build relationships between pre-screened businesses in the MENA region and companies in the developed economies (Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia). It will match buyers with sellers and provide a secure space to communicate and conduct business-to-business e-commerce transactions. It will provide users in developed economies the ease of finding and connecting with their potential partners in MENA, bypassing trade mediators and consultants, eliminating the need to maintain a physical presence in the region and mitigating risk. MENA companies will have the unique opportunity to search, compare, and buy products directly from the source and avoid paying exorbitant tariffs to local agents. Taaruf will guarantee payment and meet usersíç logistics and insurance needs. ","Taaruf grew out of Hussainíçs experience at Diligencia, where he recognised that the demand for due diligence came from companies in developed economies for two main reasons: to guarantee payment and to acquire assurance that they are dealing with legitimate businesses. However, there was no unique online platform to conduct business-to-business transactions and perform essential credibility checks. Taaruf was conceived as a solution to all these challenges. Hussain shared the preliminary specs for Taaruf with Kira in summer of 2015, and they began collaborating on Taarufíçs brand and design. They are an ideal team to make Taaruf a reality because of their combined insights into MENA markets, their backgrounds which straddle industry, regional business practices, politics, and social media. ","We have incorporated a company in the UK by the name of Taaruf.com Ltd. and have acquired its domain. We have done necessary market research, and we have received validation of our business idea from experts, including an investment banker (Barclays), an international finance professional (EBRD), two Middle East political and business analysts (EBRD and Frontier Strategy Group), and a technology startup founder (Ingrain.io). The design of Taaruf, including the preliminary features for the product, are complete. We have hired an experienced technology team that will develop the platform and provide after-launch maintenance, and we are in final negotiations with a highly experienced technology professional, who will soon be joining as our CTO.","Our customers will be companies in developed economies and MENA that are already interested in international commerce. MENA region imports over US $300 Billion worth of goods each year from developed economies. Taaruf will particularly appeal to small- and medium-sized companies wanting to expand outside their domestic markets. We plan to introduce our product during the 2016 Middle East Ecommerce Show, and we are developing a digital marketing strategy. Both founders have professional contacts in the international trade sector and in the MENA region. We plan to directly market to companies and various international trade and government regulatory bodies such as the EU Commission, U.S. Department of Commerce, Dubai Department of Economic Development, and Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority. ","There will potentially be at least four revenue streams for Taaruf: 1) Transaction fees from e-commerce transactions 2) Revenue from advertisements3) Regular membership fees from all non-MENA users4) Fees from third parties, such as shipping and insurance providers ","We are seeking GBP 25,000 from the Seed Fund. The primary use of the funds will go towards building the online platform which is going to cost between USD 18,000 to USD 22,000 (GBP 12,185 to 15,320 approx.). GBP 250 will be spent towards the design of Taarufíçs logo. GBP 2,500 to 3,500 will be spent on participation in the 2016 Middle East Ecommerce Show. The remaining GBP 11,000 will be spent on marketing and platform testing and development. This funding will provide the essential financial spark to get full development of the platform started.","Our key targets are to launch Taaruf.com, test and improve the platform and to target the first 100 users, at least a quarter of which should come from the MENA region. We will also be working to actively partner with shipping providers, such as Aramex, and insurance companies, such as Euler-Hermes, in order to have these basic services available on the Taaruf platform. Because Taaruf will provide an online space to build a B2B community and also to verify company information. Product development, piloting and testing will form a significant part of the business plan for the next year. We will develop the brand and initiate a comprehensive marketing plan to reach out to potential customers.","At the moment there are no competitors for Taaruf. There are MENA business information providers, such as Diligencia and Zawya, but no company is providing B2B e-commerce solutions for the region. Souq.com, Amazon, and eBay cater to the B2C and peer-to-peer e-commerce markets but they do not specialise in B2B sector. Alibaba provides B2C, peer-to-peer and B2B services for China. In this environment, Taaruf will be a pioneer for B2B e-commerce in MENA and will have a head-start on any potential competitors because it will not only provide a unique platform for building these relationships but will also address some of the key challenges to conducting business in the region, including risk management and monitoring, head-on.",None,Email - other,"Taaruf means í¿to introduce,íç and it comes from a root meaning í¿to know.íç The concept for this company centers on knowledge: creating a virtual space where companies can meet and feel confident in the transparency and ease of the business relationships they build there. Taaruf will provide an alternative to expensive and unreliable middlemen and regional practices of favoritism, such as Waasta, opening the market up to more dynamic competition and creating a more level and transparent playing field for companies in and outside the region. Taaruf will only allow registered companies in MENA that have been vetted by official government regulators to participate on the platform. It will also require periodic information disclosures to encourage transparency and reduce risk."01/17/2016 - 00:00,5.152.213.186,Callum murray,callum@amiqus.co,7894592687,Sole founder,Yes,,"Founder of Amiqus resolution, graduated from Stirling University in 2007 with a 2:1 in Business Studies & Entrepreneurship and formed Fresh Interior Solutions Ltd (FIS). Grew FIS from initial investment of Œ£5k to Œ£250k after two years of trading.ŒÇPrinces Scottish Youth Business Trust - Young entrepreneur of the year Scotland 2009ŒÇForced into dissolution following litigation costs in pursuit of debts through court 2012.ŒÇAccredited Civil and Commercial mediator 2013 London School of MediationŒÇAwarded í¿Young Edgeíç grant and support for í¿Amiqusíç concept July 2015ŒÇIncorporated í¿Amiqus Resolutioníç, established founding team July 2015ŒÇInaugural cohort for Scotland Can Do Scale Program MIT & Harvard- August 2015ŒÇScottish Enterprise Growth Pipeline client September 2015ŒÇIP audit _ Scottish Enterprise October 2015ŒÇPower of Youth - 'Pioneer'ŒÇEntrepreneurial Scotland - 'Future Leader'ŒÇWild Card ScotEdge winner _November 2015Founding Team Established via share option scheme (2% per person)Rik Hudson & Steven Easton Lead Developers (full time)_ web development partnership of five years specializing in creation and maintenance of large scale applications.Robbie Manson (part time)_ Product design lead - nine yearsíç experience developing and designing digital products with focus on lean product development cycle.Kathryn McBean(part time) - CFO _ Chartered accountant of fifteen years, six years operating in financial director role.Ailsa Grey(part time)- Legal / compliance - Ailsa Gray - ex lead in house counsel SSE Plc.

Tomatoes, for example, often perish after harvest due to the lack of means to preserve or process them into shelf-stable goods. As a result, processed foods are typically imported even when the raw ingredients are produced locally.Sierra Leone produces about 20,000 tonnes of tomatoes annually, but imports tomato paste, an ingredient of the local stable dish. Our company will produce canned tomato paste to replace these imports with a local product. By buying from smallholder farmers, we provide an incentive to increase production, contribute to the farmersíç income, and localise more of the value chain for a product that is already used domestically. ","Mama Tamatis has been launched prior to the MBA by Songqiao Yao, with colleagues from Cambridge University with shared interests in agriculture, food security and development. In addition to successfully raising grant funding from Smart Villages and Unlimited UK for the project, the team has established a partnership Mountain Lion Agriculture, Sierra Leone's largest rice processor (http://mlbr.org/), to conduct a pilot project with their small holder farmers. The team has a diverse background, with expertise in agriculture, finance, business and law. Through their networks at Cambridge and Oxford, its members have access to relevant resources, latest research and best practices. A team has been formed to advance Mama Tamatis during the Entrepreneurship Project of SaŒ«d Business Schoolíçs MBA program. ","We have travelled to Sierra Leone to research the value chain, develop partnerships, and plan our processing facility. Further, we tapped into the knowledge and experience of entrepreneurs who have successfully started and managed companies working with smallholder farmers in West Africa. With regards to the Entrepreneurship Project at SaŒ«d Business School, we have recruited Julian Cottee, a researcher at the Environmental Change Institute as an Oxford Collaborator.","Sierra Leone has a population of more than 6 million people. Tomatoes form an important part of the local cuisine and tomato paste is used an ingredient to make sauces that are then consumed with rice. Jallof rice, a popular rice dish prepared across West Africa is cooked primarily with a tomato based paste and is a common evening meal for families. The market for tomatoes is growing and is quite sizable with the average family in Sierra Leone spending a considerable percentage of its income on staples like tomato paste. ","Sale of tomato paste in the Sierra Leonean market. Given relatively simple processing facilities and an existing local demand, we believe that the local production and sale of tomato paste is financially sustainable.","Mamaíçs Tomatis Ltd. requires an investment of 25,000 USD and will be net present value (NPV) positive in three years. Revenues will come from selling tomato paste in cans of 70g, the standard for preparing staple dishes in Sierra Leone. The 70g can of tomato paste is currently sold for 0.20 USD (870 SLL). Our business model is focused in strengthening the local economy by sourcing tomatoes and labour locally and only selling to the home market. In addition, we will work with farmers to increase the average yield of tomatoes from 9 tonnes per hectare to 11 tonnes per hectare over the first four years of the project. After an initial assessment with agriculture business leaders from Sierra Leone, we anticipate strong local support for our product and the project.","We will secure relationships with farmers, set up our processing facility, and distribution channels to process 27 tonnes of tomatoes and realize Œ£35,000 GBP in revenue in the first year based on projections.",Our major competitors are foreign processors who export canned tomato paste to Sierra Leone. Mama Tamatis will differentiate by targeting the tastes of the local market with a local product. Mountain Lion agriculture has shown that Sierra Leoneans will pay a premium for a quality product that matches local tastes.

Basically, the concept is to partner with the local museums to deliver a programme for older people with permanent disabilities, which is similar to some existing educational programmes, including programmes for families and school children.

Prior to that worked for the Ministry of Education in the Kyrgyz Republic and the Charitable Foundation MEERIM . Her latest position was a Country Director in a regional education reforming project funded by USAID. Antonia has a real passion for children's education and truly believes in equal educational opportunities.The key competitive advantages of Oxford Study Limited are cultural understanding, professional expertise and personalised service of Dr. Antonina Santalova. Having been raised in the post-soviet state with professional experience in its educational system, she is in a strategic position to bridge the educational and cultural divide encountered by many Central Asian and Eastern European parents who want to have their children educated in the U.K. Dr. Santalova continues teaching Social Policy paper at the University of Oxford for undergraduate students of PPE, History and Natural Science departments. ",,University of Oxford alumnus/a,,Social Sciences,,Oxford Study Ltd.,oxfordstudy.org,"Oxford Study Limited is a start-up business located in Oxford, UK, specializing in comprehensive educational consulting, placement and monitoring services to parents from Central Asia and Eastern Europe who are seeking to gain the best possible higher education for their children in the U.K.  Although the provision of educational placement services is not a new idea, Oxford Study would be distinguished from existing efforts by both its focus on an underserved geographic region and its comprehensive culturally sensitive design. Importantly, the service will actively engage linguistically and culturally with parents and will be tailored to their childreníçs educational and social needs. There are five primary types of services to be provided by Oxford Study: -	Academic assessment -	Research on educational institutions-	Supervised preparation for entrance exams-	Applications review and submission.-	Monitoring of progress and periodic visits to students","This business idea began to germinate in 2010, when I started studying characteristics of education in the post-soviet states of Central Asia for my doctoral thesis. In my contacts throughout the region it was clear that a degree obtained from a Western University carried considerable weight in the eyes of local firms and governmental bodies _ much more than that of any local university. I launched a pilot effort to obtain information on what services are needed for people seeking education for their children in the UK. Then the pilot project had rather an exploratory nature. However, pilot results showed that the offer of high quality consultancy for overseas children 15-18 years old seeking education in the UK was scarce.","As with many start-ups, the greatest challenge of the first year involves gaining access to the relevant market and building networks for the distribution of services. In this regard, I have signed Cooperative Agreements with Virtual Standard Ltd on promoting Oxford Study services in Russian Federation (contract is available by request). I also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Oxbridge Education Network (Reg.N 08394108) on sharing the client bases (MoU available by request). And I have registered and am in the process of developing online marketing, as noted below. I have managed to secure financing of the start-up costs and initial operating costs for Oxford Study at my personal savings expense.","Oxford Studyíçs mission is to develop a boutique model of educational consulting and placement services catering to the special needs of the growing professional class of Central Asian and Eastern European families seeking secure the best possible education for their children in the UK. Statistics on the number of potential clients in the post-soviet states of Eastern Europe and Central Asia i.e. parents willing and financially capable to seek higher education for their children in the UK is absent. According to the Independent Schools Councilíçs Census 2014, overseas pupils make up 4.8% of the total 24,391 non-British students in the private schools. Accumulatively, about 3,000 students from the post-soviet states (incl. Ukraine, Belorussia and Central Asia) study at independent schools/colleges in the UK. This population is growing steadily.","On average the cost of Senior and Sixth-form education (from 14/15 years old to 18+) will make Œ£70-100,000 based on the statistics of Independent Schools Council.  Oxford Study services will be priced competitively with other small consulting firms, which are much lower than those charged by the large firms due to lower overhead costs. Oxford Studyíçs fees will average Œ£50.00 per hour vs Œ£180.00 per hour charged by Good Schools Survey.  In addition to the low estimated price, most of our specific services will be provided using on-line technologies such as skype and webinar platforms and hence reducing costs on transportation and accommodation in the UK.  Thus, parents will save significantly having preferred Oxford Studyíçs consultation/coaching to a Six-form college.","Based on the average empirical indicators of advertising effectiveness in VKontakte (Facebook alternative for Russian-speaking population), we can calculate the cost of transition to a landing page and a potential client. Initial calculations show that the cost pre click on ad posted in Vkontakte is approximately Œ£1. According to statistics the number of clients constitute about 2 per cent of the number of total clicks made. This makes the price per client about ~Œ£50. Thus, with a plan to attract 56-60 customers in year one demands Œ£3000 on advertisement and service promotion in social media. We seek Œ£3000 from Seed Fund as this will be the catalyst for Oxford Study to turn into a 'full body' enterprise with 56 customers and 3 members of full-time staff.","My primary objectives over the next year are to:1. Generate up to 56 clients, engaging with parents and providing comprehensive high quality service tailored to the needs of students seeking to enrol in higher education programs in the U.K.;2. Establish three full-time job places for team members; 3. Generate a net profit of Œ£22,000 by developing an initial client base and keeping overhead costs to a minimum.","Outside the UK, educational consulting services were taken on by firms organized with a core business model similar to travel agencies, similar to that of Thomas Cook or Thompson. Those pay no attention to studentsíç specific needs or charge enormous fees (e.g. Carfax). The best of these businesses are of British origin e.g. Education Advisers Ltd and Good Schools Survey Advisors. However, Oxford Study has advantages:  a) the geographic concentration on Central Asia and Eastern Europe; b) the director of Oxford Studyíçs linguistic fluency, cultural skills and educational experience related to this region; and c) the individually tailored package of services offered to students and their families.",None,Word of mouth - SaŒ«d Business School student,"Universities in the UK contribute more than Œ£7 billion to the UK economy.

Increased revenue of the state budget through taxes paid-in;2.	Improved employment rate in the country through established job places sensitive to the graduatesíç needs in flexible working hours;3.

I am currently a Graduate Entrepreneur endorsed by Oxford University. I have a long experience as a lexicographer and English teacher and have an MLitt degree in linguistics from Oxford University. I have an excellent publication record and excellent reviews on my thesis. Especially, I have written four journal articles on the area my product addresses: language reference and learning and the optimization of Google for language reference. I intend to use freelance developers to build the product. Mindful of the typical problems of freelancers, I plan to using the highly trusted freelance provider Toptal. I had one year of coding training in Python; hence, although my coding skill is not good enough to build it, I will be able to write a clear blueprint for coding and monitor and tweak the codes. For more detail please see the document ""My quest for an ideal reference tool"", which is available at my LinkedIn Summary (requires connection) or can be sent upon request.  ",https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jinseungeu,University of Oxford alumnus/a,,Humanities,,Engle,None,"Engle is a language reference tool that helps non-native speakers of English use correct expressions while they write in English. It builds on the current use of Google as the most popular and trusted English reference tool, making it much more convenient and effective for this purpose. Find product preview here: https://goo.gl/js2jIiThis is based on my user survey last year with 72 participants, which showed:• Participants spend 21.4% of their English writing time and 93.2 hours a year on checking and improving their English. • Among all reference tools including dictionaries and automatic grammar-checkers, the one they use most frequently and find most helpful is Google search. • Only 29% of them find Google “convenient” and are “satisfied with it” as a reference tool. ","I have been working in language reference and language teaching since 2000. In mid-2000 I discovered the Web as a language reference tool with a potential to be developed into something much more powerful than any dictionaries. Thus I switched my interest to the Web and started researching in this area. In 2009 I launched a test tool entitled Koedori in Korea, which confirmed the need with enthusiastic responses and is collecting live query data. At Oxford I tried a more academically oriented approach, which is yet to see the completion. Last year I did a serious user survey as mentioned above, which fundamentally changed my idea about the tool. I brought all these experiences together to design Engle.    ","I have developed and experimented with several different designs of the tool and finally come up with the design of Engle, profoundly shaped by the eye-opening results of the user survey. The basic idea of Engle is that Google is currently the most powerful reference tool but not optimized for language reference, and thus optimizing Google for language reference will create the most powerful reference tool, surpassing Google itself, This will not only significantly reduce users’ language check time but more importantly enable them to get results that are not possible with the current manual use of Google. I am currently fine-tuning the design and will be able to complete a blue print for coding within a month or so. ","They are the non-native speakers of English who write often in English, including international students and scholars, business writers, translators, and casual writers (who write English for fun or social purpose). In 2012 the number of non-native users of English was estimated at 580 million. The market for Engle would be a substantial subset of this. I plan to reach out to them through following channels: • My personal contacts (including members of my English learning site and survey participants) and viral marketing • Content marketing: online English learning communities, blogs • Targeted outreach of universities, international corporations, English teachers, and learning institutes • Search engine optimization and pay-per-click (LinkedIn) • Advertising on online dictionary sites","Engle will be provided free for light use up to a certain number of searches per month. Heavier uses will be charged according to the number of searches. The paying users will be able to save and leave comments on their searches for future reference. A video guide for basic-level use of Engle will be provided free. However, guides of advanced-level techniques may be sold at a small price. As the number of users rise, the site can attract English-related ads.","25k. I will used it mainly to hire freelance developers to build the MVP as well as to cover the legal and marketing costs. I have an offer of 15k from ISIS Software Incubator, but this fund is quite limited and has many restrictions. ","Launch the product within 3~4 months, get great traction, and raise great investment. ","The greatest competition is Google itself. Engle provides four different search options and guides users to the correct option based on how much they know about their target sentence, ensuring they take full advantage of what Google has to offer. The input interface executes option-specific Google searches with a minimum user input by manipulating the relevant Google features. The output module scans the search results and extracts only the clean and relevant example sentences and frequency reports, displaying results of multiple searches in a clear, single view with various options to get more contents and information. Automatic grammar-checkers are highly unreliable (current accuracy rate below 30%) and have made minuscule progress over the last thirty years of development.

According to the 2015 annual fillings of UK water companies, approximately £60.0 million was dedicated annually to bathing water pollution control measures. Prokarya has a revolutionary new approach which enables this high resolution microbial source tracking, meaning for the first time water companies can pinpoint exactly which assets most impact bathing water quality.",During my research it quickly became evident that there was a commercial demand for this service with no one meeting this need.  High level discussions with a number of water companies confirmed market demand and willingness to pay.

We will reach them by targeted marketing such as our recent successful advertorial in a national water journal and attending conferences tailored to the issues we are able to assist with.  In addition Gregg's existing network is proving invaluable in creating relationships with decision makers.  The UK water industry will spend over £350m on improving bathing water quality in the years 2016 – 2021.  The investment strategy is based on assumption of bacterial source on the back of hydrological studies.  In one case a company spent £6m building a tank to “see what happens”.  In this context we can provide valuable information to the industry, helping improve investment efficiency and improve water quality.","The wastewater companies will engage Prokarya as consultants and collaboratively design a sampling program which will enable pinpointing of microbial pollution, mainly in bathing waters.  Prokarya will process the samples and analyse the data in order to provide a report detailing our findings.  This model is already in use with hydrological studies and is accepted within the water industry.  Our pricing has been confirmed as acceptable by 5 of the 10 UK wastewater companies with bathing waters, one of which is current in negotiations for a contract with the other 4 having expressed concrete interest.","We are seeking £25k, of which £4849 will pay for an apprentice lab technician and the remaining £20151 will pay for a business graduate to take up the role of business development manager.  The lab apprentice will ensure business continuity in the event that Gregg becomes incapacitated for a time and will also free up Gregg's time for new product development.  This is a great opportunity for a talented apprentice to receive degree level specialist training.  The business development manager would help to increase awareness within the industry and enable a greater number of customer interactions than Gregg can manage alone.  It is a great opportunity for a young graduate to be a formative part of an exciting new business.","Our forecasted turnover is £180,000 of which £150,000 will come from 3 small microbial source tracking projects one of which is already under negotiation.

By using (and re-using) their own bottles, the users will do their contribution to the environment by reducing the amount of plastic waste created.  ","Back in the year 2000, Cristobal travels to California for several weeks and quickly becomes a user of the water vending machines. He immediately identified Chile as a potential market for this unconventional way of selling purified water. Due to work commitments and various other circumstances the idea only rests calm in his head until early 2015 when he shared his vision with Isabel, Arturo and Joaquin. They all agree that the Chilean market was more prepared than never before; there is a preference for environmentally friendly products & services, an increased interest for healthier living, and a sustained growth in bottled water consumption of about 12.6% per year.","We are currently undergoing our first pilot installation consisting of two machines operating at a major shopping center mall. One machine for bulk water vending ('Bulk' refers to larger amounts of purified water being sold from a water vending machine, typically in 5, 12 and 20 Lt Volumes). And the second machine for “single serve” volumes. (Single-serve water vending involves dispensing chilled, ready-to-drink, purified water for immediate consumption, most typically in 0.5 and 1 Lt Volumes)We have a 5 years business plan already developed and in the process of being implemented. Our goal is to achieve 100 machines by the end of the fifth year of operation.We have most of the branding completed but with the arrival of the first machines we have identified some potential from improvement in that matter.","Our client is everyone who drinks water regularly, that have some level of interest for a better living, health, and sustainability.We will reach our customers by providing a sustainable, healthy, convenient and affordable way of consuming purified water.For the last ten years, the water consumption has been growing at an average of 12.6% per year. In 2013, Chile consumed about 393 Millions of liters of bottled water, 10.5% of that corresponds to purified water, and the remaining is distributed between mineral and flavored water. A great gap and potential for growing is identified by comparing the 22 liters per year per person consumed in Chile with the 98 and 186 lt/year per person consumed in the US and Mexico respectively.","The business model predicts a 69%% net profit. It requires a high volume of sales, but it sees the benefit of having minimum inventory, immediate cash collection, and very little accounts payable.We will aim to offer very competitive prices, alternative payment methods and an installation footprint that pretends to maximize the chance for reaching our product.We have designed different agreement styles to better adapt the requirements of each location with the objective to beneficiate all parties.   ","Our business plan considers purchasing and installing 12 vending machines in the first year, as well as having a fully implemented service support, web site and a robust marketing plan. The estimated cost of this would reach to about £40,000.If we were awarded with funding, we would invest a portion in purchasing new machines to contribute to the installation footprint. We would also invest in marketing, brand positioning, and to investigate further the possibility of sourcing the design and manufacture of the vending machines in Chile as oppose to suppliers from Asia.","Our targets are a successful implementation and market response to our pilot installation. To introduce and operate 10 additional machines, and to do enough brand positioning/promotion so that we start changing the usual way of consuming bottled water and creating more conscious about the current wasteful industry of bottled water. ","Our direct competitors are companies that produce and distribute bottled water, of any format and size. They have the advantage of having strong distribution channels and strategic partnerships to allow for national coverage.Our differentiation factor relies on sustainability and affordability. We provide a cost efficient and environmentally friendly concept that will dramatically reduce drinking water costs. We are a Green-thinking, environmentally focused company, dedicated to improving health and reducing the carbon footprint while continually increasing savings on people´s budgets",None,Saïd Business School website,"There is an increasing interest of Chileans to look for more environmentally conscious products and living.

Founded to address the widespread lack of cultural diversity in children’s publishing, Lantana works closely with authors and illustrators to produce and publish high quality picture books for primary-aged children that celebrate diverse cultures, beliefs and worldviews. Our book exploring Syrian culture in the wake of the migrant crisis is particularly in demand. We print our books in Hong Kong and sell them to domestic and international customers via our ecommerce website and to the UK school, library and trade sectors via trade agreements with suppliers. We also license the right to reproduce our books in other languages to international publishing houses. ","Lantana Publishing was registered in the UK as a private limited company on 21st August 2014, with the company’s two directors holding equal shares. Both Alice and Caroline had long been aware that books created by authors or illustrators of diverse ethnic backgrounds amount to less than 5% of the UK’s total publishing output. With around 12.8% of the UK population registered as non-white British (increasing fourfold in London where Lantana is based), such a percentage does not sufficiently reflect the UK’s demographic, leaving both a serious social problem and an entirely untapped consumer base. Alice’s and Caroline’s combined academic, publishing and teaching experience lays strong foundations for a commercial company with a strong social impact.","Since founding the company in August 2014, we have signed 12 authors and illustrators, most of whom have previously won international writing and illustration awards. Our first three titles were published in October 2015, each receiving outstanding reviews from bloggers and educators. Two more picture books are scheduled for April, and three more are in development. We have recently secured six wholesale key accounts and sold nearly 600 books via our website and trade partners. Our website customers span 20 countries. We have sold translation rights to publishing houses in Malaysia and Spain. In only 3 months our gross revenue has gone from nothing to £3k. With a suitable injection of capital, we are confident sales will rapidly increase.","The UK pre-school and picture book sector saw growth of 6% in 2015 to £72m. Increased demand for diverse titles initiated by the We Need Diverse Books campaign has ensured that Lantana is well-placed to take advantage of this expanding market. Customers fall into two categories - middle class consumers with young families, and the trade: schools, libraries and bookshops. To attract the first, we have launched a targeted social media campaign via Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram and our blog. We emphasise that to buy a Lantana title is not only to buy a beautiful book but to participate in a growing social movement towards a more inclusive society. To attract the second, we secure key accounts with suppliers. ","Lantana has three main revenue streams – sales via our ecommerce platform, trade sales, and foreign rights and export sales. For the first, we are diversifying our product range and offering personalised products and special add-ons to attract a loyal customer base. These include signed and gift-wrapped books sold at higher margins, art prints chosen by website customers, a subscription sales model that generates cash flow, and a USP for teachers: educational resources free to download from our website. For the second, we have hired a dedicated sales representative on a part-time basis to scale up our trade sales efforts. For the third, we have hired a foreign rights representative on a commission-basis to introduce our books to foreign markets.  ","We are seeking £19,000 from Seed Fund. Gross margins on sales via our ecommerce platform are double those on trade sales. Consequently we intend to use £10,000 to drive higher volumes of customers to our website (c£6,500 on hiring a digital marketing consultant to design a targeted marketing campaign, and c£3,500 on improved SEO and paid advertising). Future growth will rely on increasing the volume of our products on the market and we intend to use £9,000 to produce and publish three new picture books with pre-Christmas and early 2017 release dates. If these two development strands are achieved, our profits are set to more than quadruple in the next 18 months.","With three months’ trading history, we have now validated our business concept. Achievements so far have laid the foundations for future growth: we have attracted award-winning authors and illustrators, achieved respect in the industry for both the quality of our books and our company’s social aspirations, and have begun to secure key accounts with trade clients. Growth relies on increasing our volume of products and consolidating our website consumer base. Key business targets for next year include:- publishing eight original picture books (almost tripling our product volume)- doubling our website customer base- opening a minimum of three more key accounts with trade suppliers- raising our foreign rights revenue to 25% of our gross income. ","While diversity is receiving much media attention (with the recent Oscars debate fuelling public concern), only a handful of publishers in the UK have a diversity-related USP. Barefoot Books closed its UK-branch in December 2015 to concentrate its sales efforts in the US, leaving the UK market wide open. Frances Lincoln recently announced its move to non-fiction rather than children’s books. Small independent outfits like Tiny Owl Press focus on a specific market category – Iranian fiction in English – with limited consumer appeal. Lantana’s focus on high quality, diverse fiction is largely unique, and a popular draw card for teachers for whom world cultures are a national curriculum staple.

Completion of DPhil in October 2017. ,"Oliver van Hecke is a DPhil student (2nd year) and General Practitioner in Oxford.  He plans to complete his DPhil in October 2017. Joseph Lee is an Academic Clinical Fellow and General Practitioner in Oxford. Both applicants work in the Department of Primary Care Health Sciences and collaborate on academic research projects related to infectious diseases and antibiotic resistance.  We have developed the idea in our spare time using our hands-on experience as clinicians treating and interacting with patients. ",,Current University of Oxford postgraduate,,Medical Sciences,,Ubi-GP™,None,"Our product is an app-based instant access service for when you can’t get an appointment with your regular general practitioner (GP). We call it Ubi-GP ™ (short for ubiquitous-GP). Ubi-GP uses your smartphone's GPS to detect your location and tracks when the next available consultation slot will be free in your vicinity, and puts you in direct contact with that practice. Access to health care is a problem - patients are finding it increasingly difficult to access general practice at a time convenient to them.   Access can mean very different things depending on an individual’s priorities. Some patients value proximity of care, others timeliness, or the ability to see a preferred GP or nurse.  Ubi-GP addresses these needs.","We are early career, practising GPs and academic researchers at the University of Oxford.  We wanted to explore and give an alternative to patients frustrated with the current model of access to general practice.  Online access to medical services will grow massively in the next few years, encouraged by the government.  As of 31 March 2016, GP practices will be required to promote and offer patients online access to their medical records (https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/pe/patient-online/), and IT infrastructure is in place to enable this.  Improving patients’ access to their health records is central to encouraging self-management of long-term conditions, but is also an opportunity to offer patients the freedom to obtain timely access to services at a time convenient to them. ","Our idea is at an early stage.  It has been presented as a dangerous idea at an academic conference, and we have investigated the imminent changes for patients accessing their medical records electronically.  Our preliminary business model for Ubi-GP is based on four principles: 1.	One tap to connect: Portable access to decide when and where you are seen. 2.	Reliable connection: Choose your preferred method of communication - per telephone, Skype or face-face consultation. 3.	Paperless and convenient: Once you have made your selection, you can opt to send your electronic medical records to the specific GP practice. 4.	Feedback matters: Rate your experience and leave feedback about your consultation.","Our customers are patients and GP practices in the United Kingdom and worldwide. There were approximately 420 million general practice consultations in 2014/5 in Britain. We aim to develop this novel service through pilot work with practices and patients and adapt it through further input from key stakeholders before promoting it via social media. There is a large pool of people who would find it useful to have easier access to their GP. In addition recent rule changes have enabled patients to register with GPs far from their homes, and GPs have been incentivised to see patients who are not registered with them, and even to visit them at home.   Ubi-GP enables these transactions to take place.","Within the NHS the cost for patients will be nil.  The value lies in the sheer number of consultations within general practice per year and the revenue potential from health-related advertising, targeted at both patients and the valuable GP market. Practices that see patients in their clinic or at home using Ubi-GP will be compensated by the NHS in the usual way.  There is potential to automate their fee claims, increasing the appeal of the service for doctors.  A small proportion of this income will be charged.   Alternatively, we can adapt our business plan to a fee-for-service model of care whereby greater costs will be incurred by the patient, more relevant to expanding overseas markets and private healthcare.","1. Exploratory work and consultation with key stakeholders (e.g. NHS England, Clinical Commissioning Groups, Patient Online, GP practices, patients, MRHA) - £4,0002. Development of the Ubi-GP app, its feasibility and integration within current online platform of booking system - £15,000.3. Promotion and piloting of the service to GPs and patients - £4, 000","We have four key business targets for the next 12 months: 1. Secure funding to develop and build the app.  2. Explore the feasibility of our product and tailor our business plan to work within a future NHS model of care.  3. Pilot and evaluate the service in a small geographical area. 4. Build the case for larger investment. If this proves not feasible, our intention will be to adapt our business plan to a fee-for-service model of care.","Although there are smartphone apps offering online booking, these have been developed on an individual practice level by a small number of GP practices. Our approach will be different as it will harness the potential of smartphone GPS location and patient movement; build on the proposed online booking system and patient access of medical records in primary care; and the ability to integrate into the current clinical systems used in general practice. Others have tried to evaluate patient access and tailor a specific solution for that individual practice (GP Access (http://gpaccess.uk/), offer patients telephonic (Benenden Healthcare BUPA) or video access (Push Doctor).

The aim of the initiative is to ensure grassroots development of football in India. The current modus operandi is to rent out playing facilities such as astro-turfs, private and public grounds, and conduct football training on these facilities. We are also operating in schools, training the school football team and conducting after-hours training for other interested kids in the school.What differentiates us from other competitors offering football coaching in India is the quality of training we have ensured. We have given great thought to the manner in which our training sessions are conducted, influenced greatly by practices in strong footballing nations. ","SoccerCubs became operational in 2014, when it was started on a single astro-turf in the city of Thane, close to Mumbai by Prashant. I, Sumit joined the startup as a part of a joint venture between SoccerCubs and my physical education startup NurtureSports in June 2014. By October 2014, I had taken over as the CEO of SoccerCubs and was solely responsible for all business decisions. What brought us to this point was:a)	Both of us being football fans, it hurt us to see the low quality of football and football coaching offered in Mumbai, a tier-A city of India.b)	We both had the passion to work towards improving this situation, and the right set of complementary skills.  ","We are now operating at 7 centers in the city of Mumbai, coaching around 250 students, and looking at revenue generation of around 37,500 GBP for the year with these numbers. We have deliberately grown slowly so far, in order to establish a proper model that can be easily replicated. Currently, the profit per student per year is about 18 GBP.The on-the-ground success of the academy is in the fact that our kids won 9 local youth tournaments in the city in year 2015, with various runners up and third place finishes.We are now set for fast expansion, and are in talks with a group of schools in another city that will take the count of centers to 9. "," Our customers are young kids (their parents) aged 4-17.  There are 315 million students in India according to the government census 2011, and we believe 50% of them, i.e. about 160 million students is the size of the market we are looking at.We usually start a new academy by organizing a small youth tournament at the center, where our teams from other academies participate. This is a strong marketing tool for us as our teams usually do well in these tournaments. We also reach out to all the schools and housing societies in the vicinity of the rented facility, and distribute our brochures that talk about our offerings. We also offer a free one-week trial at the new centers.","We make money by charging the students on a monthly basis for the football training services we offer.Our major costs are facility rents and trainer wages. We have been charging very low fees at this stage and paying high rental costs to astro-turfs. By moving away from the main city, we will be operating more on public and private grounds (due to lack of astroturfs), which will reduce the rent to about 1/8th-1/10th of what we pay now. That will improve our margins drastically and make us highly profitable. We are also in talks to get associated with a top tier Spanish football club, which will allow us to charge a high premium, improving our margins further.","We seek 11,000 GBP from seed fund for our plan over the next 12 – 14 months.

With materials R&D being prohibitively expensive, data can make the difference between being hobbyist and becoming an entrepreneur, or between a good idea and a competitive product.  Opan enables the growing number of small materials producers to enter the market and compete by providing access to materials testing equipment. When producers characterise their latest recycled polymer or bioplastic and upload the data, consumers can buy with confidence. ","We met at Oxford through a mutual friend in May 2015.  Gerardo was interested in 3D printing, and shared his interest in building tools for materials testing.

If 50% of visitors buy 1 KG of 3D printing material per month, a 2% transaction fee yields a monthly revenue goal of $66,000, or $792,000 per year.    Our social key performance indicators are: (1) dollars invested in local economies, measured when customers buy from local material producers; (2) waste diverted from landfill with every pound of recycled material sold; and (3), CO2 savings from users buying local instead of imported materials.  ","Our unique position comes from our focus on user-generated materials data accompanied by open source testing tools and a purchasing interface.  MatWeb, Citrine, Additively, and Senvol offer professional materials data, yet they do not offer a buyer interface for consumers.  Consumer platforms for 3D printing materials do not offer quality data on material properties, supply chain sources, or environmental metrics.  We will offer the full range of new materials entering the market, with accompanying analytics and software modelling interfaces.

This problem is also exacerbated for students who are not in specialised finance or MBA programs and don't have a strong infrastructure to inform them of what they need to know and fellow students who are interested in prepping with. This platform allows students out of the loop (who are still a large proportion of applicants) to get up to speed. For more switched on candidates, it gives them a ground to further improve, assess the level of other candidates, practice at their convenience, and not rely on resource constraints of their university career services.","I have tested a basic MVP by posting on student forums to see if other applicants in investment banking were interested to arrange practice interviews over Skype to see if there was demand for the underlying concept. Given that this is at the very tail end of the application season, I found that there was still demand to practice for future interviews. In addition to this, I have built a landing page for the business that I will use to test if people would be interested in signing up for such a platform. This is currently reaching its completion and I am looking to roll this out on student forums and among finance / MBA students to further validate the business.","My target customers are university students (undergraduates, masters students, and MBAs)  looking to apply for spring weeks, summer internships, off-cycle internships, and full-time programs in the investment banking division (IBD), sales and trading, and asset management. I plan to reach my customers through connections, finance societies, and careers services at universities such as Oxford, Cambridge, LSE, Warwick, and Trinity College Dublin. The idea will be to focus on the UK and US markets first, before looking into Asia.At minimum, the initial potential market size is 17,000 students as this was the number quoted in the WSJ for the number of applicants applying to Goldman Sachs' summer internship program. In addition to this, we will be targeting spring weeks, off-cycle internships, MBA internships, and analyst / associate recruitment. Additionally, we will be looking to expand into other industries, making the potential market size the number of job-hunting students worldwide. ","There are several possible routes to market with this idea. Primarily, we are looking to use a freemium subscription model to charge customers for using our service. This will work by giving users who sign up access to basic interview questions to try out the platform and the content will bring applicants to the level of a first round interview. However, in order to gain further access to content and regular interview practice, they will have to pay a monthly subscription fee. This will only be implemented after the network of users has been built up, as this is the value of the platform.Second, we plan to provide adjacent services such as CV and cover letter reviews, expert interviews, and mentoring services. The business will simply take a commission (e.g. if an expert charges say £100 for a session, we would take £20).Finally, we could also consider partnering with universities and providing our platform and services to them for a fee. This is merely a consideration and needs further exploration.","We are seeking to raise £15,000 from the Seed Fund. This will be used to build the website's infrastructure as it will require quite advanced web development to integrate video, content, payment, and a large user base. This is pivotal to the business as it will allow us to quickly build a large user base, rather than relying on piecemeal offerings while we gather the funds to develop the website into full functionality. The attraction of this business is that it operates with low variable costs and once the infrastructure is in place, it is much easier to scale.","Our current business targets are as follows and subject to further revision:1. Complete customer validation2. Develop our platform before the start of recruitment (September)3. Scale our platform to at least 500 users by the end of the calendar year4. Create a professional network with at least 5 professionals from the major financial institutions (bulge brackets and elite boutiques)","Our major competitor by platform is PrepLounge. They offer the same platform but focused on interview prep for management consulting. Our platform differs in that it is focused on people interested in investment banking, a sector which does require a specific set of skills to operate this sort of business in.Our major competitors within finance are WallstreetOasis, Mergers & Inquisitions, and Breaking Into Wallstreet. We differ because we allow candidates to practice interviews with each other, the others do not. Their services are based on prep packs, CV and cover letter reviews, and expert interviews. We will also be looking to offer these services, but at a lower price point than these competitors. We believe that students will choose our platform because it is more convenient, allow applicants to assess their relative strength to other applicants, and they will be able to achieve the same or better outcome at a lower cost.",None,Email - College newsletter,02/07/2016 - 18:53,1,Jibran  Qureshi,jqureshi@clearhouseaccountants.co.uk,7515256420,Co-founder,No,"10-15 hours per week.July 2016","Renate Kalnina (Founder and Managing Director) is ambitious leader with over 12 years of combined experience in traditional and digital tech media.

I learned important lessons of the Silicon Valley and established crucial relationships with people who are now my mentors from Airbnb and other successful startups. I came back to Oxford excited to have found the perfect place to launch my cycling startup. In September 2015, I recruited my co-founder Peter who brings experience working with China, environmental markets and later stage startups.","We have a fully functioning platform that has been successfully tested with the first hundred users, partnerships with a bike shop (Broken Spoke), cycling groups (Cyclox, Cowley Condors), and Oxford Council. We are in discussions with Chiltern Railways.","The cycling industry is a $50 billion dollar market. We will disrupt that market and put sharable bicycles on the map. In the short term, we estimate to generate £10-30m of annual fee revenues in the UK and Europe. Oxford will be the testing ground for the best channels to reach different customer segments (travelers, students, visitors, cycling enthusiasts, and residents).","We will charge a transaction fee (10-20%) and potentially generate ad revenues. The short term potential for a city like Oxford is 5,000-10,000 bikes on cycle.land. There are hundreds of similar cities across the UK and Europe. Assuming an average annual fee income of £10 per bike, we will generate £50-100k in Oxford and £10-30m in the UK and Europe. ","We are seeking £25k. We will primarily use it to gain substantial traction in Oxford through aggressive marketing, community engagement, and partnerships with key stakeholders. Our market research shows that we can an attract more users by offering insurance. Some of the funds will be used to insure the bikes.With that funding we will build a strong, sustainable  bike sharing community in Oxford generating annual revenues of  £50-100k. The success in Oxford will enable us to raise additional funding of £150k and launch cycle.land in other places such as Cambridge, Brighton, Bristol and East London.","By August 2016, we will raise another £150k through SEIS investment and bring cycle.land to Cambridge, Bristol, Brighton, and parts of East London. By 2017 February we will raise £1-5million through EIS to expand into the rest of the UK, Europe and make plans for China.","Unlike traditional bike rental providers (local bike shops, public bike sharing systems), cycle.land is a one stop shop to rent a unique bicycle anywhere in the world. While there are companies working on peer-to-peer bike sharing platforms (Spinlister in the USA), no company has a global monopoly. Spinlister has stayed  focused on the US and higher-end bikes. Our research shows that Europe is a more favorable market for peer-to-peer bike sharing. Cycle.land is focused on launching in the UK, offering all ranges of bikes, and catering to peer-to-peer as well as professional bike renters (we will incorporate local bike rental shops). With the knowledge and experience from Airbnb, cycle.land aims to be the first bicycle marketplace to raise substantial investment and reach liquidity globally.

We offer existing health facilities with a one-stop solution to augment their capabilities and share in revenue from services without needing to invest in new equipment or expertise. We want to become Africa’s largest provider of medical imaging services. Our founders built on their deep experience in maternal health in Kenya and globally to create a health care services business model that is innovative, sustainable, and high-impact. ","Our co-founders worked together during the startup phase of Jacaranda Health, a social enterprise in Kenya building a chain of affordable, high-quality maternity hospitals. As part of Jacaranda's growth, we launched an ultrasound service that, by training up nurse-midwives and optimizing throughput, could offer a basic obstetric scan at half the prevailing rate (~$10). Using existing portable devices with reputation for quality and durability, Jacaranda found massive demand (20+ scans per day), and the service became its single largest revenue generator. Matt and  Edwin reconnected in 2015 to discover that each had been researching a similar service model for other health facilities; from there we deepened the business model, refined the branding, and registered Tulivu in August 2015.","Tulivu Imaging was registered as a company in Kenya in August 2015. We have spent the beginning of 2016 recruiting a local team to drive market research, business development, and operations, and establishing key partnerships that will position us for growth.  We have already established several types of key partnerships, e.g., Medical device companies (GE verbally committed to donating two Vscan Access devices for the pilot; Philips and Medtronic are also highly interested in support for and learning from our model).Government stakeholders (Embakasi district committed to hosting pilot teams in 2-4 facilities)Medical advisors: Radiologists on board for training and telemedicine-based chart reviews In February 2016, we also will conduct a more detailed market testing and business development process.","Our target market is medium-sized hospitals and clinics in the public and private sectors. Looking at 18 priority counties in Kenya that have sufficient density and infrastructure, there are almost 500 facilities that see between 30 and 200 new antenatal clients per month. These facilities make up the backbone of health care in the country: while they represent 15% of the number of clinics, the serve over half of all clients – over 370,000 new antenatal cases per year. Several neighbors such as Uganda, Tanzania, and Ethiopia represent comparable (if slightly smaller) markets. Extrapolating, we see a market of at least 2,000 health facilities in peri-urban East Africa as a whole. ","Tulivu, like most health care in East Africa, is fee for service. Our clients (ultrasound and eventually other diagnostics) will pay us the equivalent of US$10 via mobile money, and we will share 10-20% of revenue back with facilities. We are confident in our willingness to pay analysis due to comparables from Jacaranda Health showing that that when priced more affordably (e.g., at $10), women across all income levels are highly willing to save and pay for ultrasound when they see value for money. Analysis by GE on its new portable Vscan Access Ultrasound have also validated a $10 price point as where market would see exponential demand increases such that the service becomes routine. ","We are seeking £25,000 as a convertible note to fund the setup and initial growth of Tulivu. We are planning on bootstrapping a two-week pilot in April 2016, refining the operational model based on that client feedback, and then launching the full model in July 2016, when the members of our team currently based in the UK will be available full time in Kenya. This funding is catalytic as the nature of this business model (fee for service and a relatively low cost base) means that we can launch services with low investment requirements. We have a clear sense of our unit-level breakeven point (9 scans per day), and relationships with suppliers and training providers to allow for early growth. ","We will launch with two ultrasound teams, serving public and private sector facilities in Nairobi and Kisumu.  In total we aim to launch six Tulivu teams in our first full year of operations, which will serve 45 health facilities, and conduct 17,000 scans.We project full cost recovery in year 2, growth to US$2.7M in turnover by year 5, and a profit margin in the low double digits. By 2020, we anticipate staffing 65 Tulivu teams, serving almost 500 health facilities, and conducting 265,000 procedures per year. ","We think about four types of competitors:Hospitals investing in their own equipment: Facilities may buy new equipment based on proof of market viability; mitigate through incentivize for lock-in and moving up the value chain to distributionStandalone diagnostics centres: Comprehensive imaging centres mainly targeting higher-end markets; Tulivu should maintain focus on smaller facilities and lower-income areas; leverage our lower cost baseLabs with collection networks: Centralised laboratories with courier networks to collect specimens (not relevant for early service lines); assess by testing client preferences for point-of-care testing versus offsite analysisEmerging service models: There are some affordable distribution and service model startups emerging; could be candidates for partnership as Kenya players are very small without plans for substantial growth",None,Word of mouth - Saïd Business School student,02/07/2016 - 20:59,1,Adam Bacon,adam.bacon@yahoo.com,07870 763266,Co-founder,Yes,n/a,"Adam is Mamaby’s CEO.

How often has it helped people in need in China, or Thailand, or India? At Mamaby, our vision is to produce and sell healthy ready-to-eat food from around the world, with profits going back to support causes from the same place as the food. Our first food is a healthy baked vegetable samosa, and our first cause is pregnancy care in Indian slums.","We planted the seed for Mamaby in 2014 whilst solving the Hult Prize challenge, on Non-Commmunicable Diseases (NCDs) in slums. This seed grew in January 2015 during a research project we conducted, investigating access to healthcare in Mumbai slums. Here, we observed both, the crushing financial burden of NCD treatment, and also the crippling level of malnutrition in children. We realised more can be done during pregnancy to prevent both of these conditions, and, led by Elina, set about designing a “one-stop-shop” for pregnancy care in slums, including nutrition, diagnostics and education. Our greatest obstacle: sustainable long-term provision. With experience in operations, strategy and FMCG, Adam joined, developing our sustainable business model and building our commercial operations in the UK. ","In December we conducted a survey on 200 people to learn more about their eating and giving habits. Through this we identified our early adopters: university students. We also conducted a small sales pilot, with our minimum viable product (a samosa with no packaging and minimal branding); we sold 25 units. We have also been incubated with Prime Advocates, who are assisting with strategy, network and legal. We are progressing towards formal proof of concept in Oxford. Here we have received strong interest from University College who wants to stock our product in their buttery and also include it in their summer ball. We are aiming to commence these operations in March 2016.","Our early adopters are Oxford students, we will reach them via college and departmental canteens. From our December Survey, we discovered that the average student spend per day on ready-to-eat food is £5.80 with an average frequency of 14 times per month. This makes the market for student spending on ready-to-eat food per year in: (1) Oxford University is around £12m; and (2) for the UK in total approximately £300m. Beyond students, we will target the Millennials, who are distinguished by their propensity to side with brands that are underpinned by ethical principles. The size of the market for Millennials spending on ready-to-eat food is estimated at £9.3bn per year. We will reach them via national retailers and social campaigning.","We will make money through sales of food products. Our first product is a healthy baked vegetable samosa. Currently, this product retails for £2 each with a gross margin of £1.40 (with store margin of 30%, ingredients at 13p, and packaging at 10p). Each samosa contributes £0.17 to Net Operating Profit Before Tax (NOPBT) (including staff, rent and distribution). The most significant contributor to cost is in staff wages and rent, since our current production is entirely manual. With Seed Fund’s investment we would obtain machinery to automate the filling and shaping of the samosas. This would result in estimated time savings of 40% and increase the per samosa contribution to NOPBT to £0.57.","We are seeking £25k from Seed Fund. This will be used to help us take our operations beyond proof of concept:- Product Development (£5,000): shelf-life lab testing and packaging upgrade to bespoke design.- Marketing (£8,000): producing fliers and digital content, targeted social media advertising, and development of “Personal Impact” app to enhance our consumer’s experience by allowing them to track the impact of their purchases with us.- Production & Distribution Improvement (£12,000): scaling up production to a larger facility with improved processes, automated machinery (i.e. samosa maker, pastry roller), and 3rd party chilled distribution.","Stock our product in 10 Oxford University Colleges (Estimated Revenue £30k)Stock our product in 10 stores/cafes in Oxford (Estimated Revenue £15k)Serve 10,000 samosas (Estimated Revenue £15k) at events (800 confirmed with Oxford University for University College Ball and Tri-Innovate) Expand portfolio to 3 “food with a cause” snacksRaise additional funding to enable national scaleStock our products in at least one national retailer","Our “social food” competitors include KIND, Plant for Peace, and Aduna. These brands focus on dry super-food-containing products, which have more third party manufacturing options, so the market has lower barriers to entry, and their products are vulnerable to super-food fashions. In contrast, our product is a refrigerated snack; here, our main “social” competitors are the likes of Social Bite, which supports good causes and has grown quickly to five sandwich outlets in Scotland. Our difference is our unique consumer experience, where our food and cause share their origin.

Our system will enable oil and gas companies to reduce their well cost while increasing their total oil & gas production over the life of the well. We will reduce our customers well costs by decreasing the time required to frack a well which usually is in the range of $200,000/day for a completion opperation.  Our technology will also enable companies to drill and compleate a longer horizontal well length.  Many companies are wanting to drill longer wells because it reduces the number of wells required to develop a oil and gas field, lowers capital expenditure and increasing field development economics, however current completion technology is one of the biggest technical barriers to achieving this.  We will improve oil & gas output by allowing greater frack stage frequency, reduced frac pressures and will provide the ability to recomplete individual stages during future workovers which is currently impossible with existing technologies. This system is also low risk for the oil and gas company because if our sleves fail they can still complete the well using the traditional ""Plug and Perf"" method.  We will manufacture and supply sleeves, manufacture and rent activating tools, and provide field support services to the customer's while the tools are being run.","The idea of a closable fracking sleeve emerged during a discussion on a new technology's potential application in the oil and gas industry. After a brainstorming session, we came up with several initial ideas in November 2015. Since then, there have been a number of pivots and changes as we have further come to understand the technical requirements, market and competitive landscape. Our product is a niche product that will address a common costly industry problem.  Successfully addressing the challenge is of great reward to our customers, and therefore to our company.","We have started working with an IP attorney, and have produced initial CAD drawings of the tool. We expect to have a finalized product by mid to end of Q2 2016. Our bottleneck will be finding our first well to perform a proof of concept.","Our customers are oil and gas production companies who are operating onshore shale oil and gas fields like XTO, Shell, Chevron, EnCana, and many mid-tier and junior oil producers. We will reach them through existing industry contacts, networking and old school cold contacting tactics. The market is VERY easy to size, and does change with the oil price. The number of land based oil rigs (machines that drill new wells) is a public number, currently 545 in the US. A rig drills on average 2 wells a month; so we have approximately 1,100 wells in total per month or 13,000 wells a year as our current market size at today's rock bottom oil prices. The rig count will increase when the oil price eventually rebounds. Each well will require around 60 units of our tool at $10,000 each. $600,000 multiplied by 13,000 wells equals approximately a $8b market size today. Previously, at $100 oil, the rig count was over 1,800 (tripling the market size).","We will receive revenue through selling & renting our equipment, and through installation services. The fracking sleeves will be sold at a 40-60% gross margin. The tool required to install activate these sleeves will be rented out at US$6,000 per day.  Service technicians will be mobilized to support the installation and operation and charged out at a daily rate of US$1,200 (we expect 2 technicians will be required per deployment).   ","Our IP filing costs are expected to be about $15,000. Additionally, we have rough estimates of $8k to build our prototypes. There are also likely to be testing costs - we have yet to nail down a precise figure for this. Our intent is to build-to-order rather than build-to-stock due to specification dependent variation in pipe grade and size. This will allow us to do PO financing on the upfront cost of the sleeves for our first sale. £25,000 will give us a decent runway to patent and build / test a prototype, and leverage the prototype to find the first customer.","1.

This is quick and cheap, but has a limited number of stages and lower lateral length potential resulting in lower production rates  2.

The key advantages are: (1) more rapid medical input for patients - reducing admissions by earlier intervention (2) better information transfer between staff (3) more timely input from geriatric/palliative specialists (4) more evenly distributed attendance at acute services (5) proactive/preventative care (medication checks/advance directives) and home healthcare partnerships (IV fluids/medicines in the care home).","This idea stems from (i) the ~£1bn problem of hospital admissions from care homes (ii) the increasing demand and shift towards the use of remote medicine or telemedicine in the UK and in Europe (iii) Alexander’s direct experience of sub-optimal facilities in his role as a GP Academic Clinical Fellow This team has relevant expertise including success in developing an international healthcare-based technology company, implementing technology into the NHS, venture capital/business expertise, partnership with a major care home provider, and a network of geriatricians/GPs led by a senior GP partner who has overseen one of the first ‘Telephone-first’ consultation models for 15,000 patients across his network of GP practices.Most of the team have known each other for many years.","We began with market research on the current care climate, and competitive landscape; we consulted geriatricians/GPs/CCGs to both validate our assumptions on the unmet need, and explore interest in our proposal.We developed a 5 year forecast and budget, discussed proposals with multiple technology vendors, and created marketing materials/our website.This led to several key developments:(i) Ongoing discussions and EOI with a major care home provider (Sussex Healthcare - http://www.sussexhealthcare.org/; £50m turnover and >25 facilities) to invest in our company, and pilot(ii) Secured a network of GPs led by Bury Knowle Health Centre, EOI, and keen to pilot(iii) In discussion with Oxford CCG and Dr Felix Hargreaves (Deputy Director of Public Health England)(iv) Secured geriatric contacts","We have identified four potential customers and routes to access this market: (1) CCGs for whom this offering has the potential to offer an ROI of 3x whilst maintaining a ~50% gross margin for our business (2) Care homes who want to improve quality of care and demonstrate this to patients, local authorities and CCGs (3) GPs struggling with the high volume of time-consuming home visits (4) NHS Community Trusts, often led by community geriatricians, which have secured block contracts to reduce A&E admissions. UK market of £70m-£150m per year; European market of £500m-£1.1bn per year. We are poised to move into the community marketplace and the mobile health market - £5bn by 2018. ","The first stage of our commercialisation plan uses the feasibility data to target the above four segments and to secure paid pilots: we will focus on customers for whom the unmet need is particularly acute e.g. small GP practices struggling with a local residential home or CCGs who have expressed care home admissions as a strategic priority. We will also target the subset of care homes that have a financial incentive to reduce hospital admissions because NHS Continuing Health Care funding to care homes is postponed when a patient is admitted. CCGs are difficult to penetrate because of their long sale-cycle so the second stage will use the clinical data generated in the first stage to market to CCGs.","Requests for proposals indicate that the total technology cost will be £50k. We are seeking £25k and we have prospective investors who will match this. Additionally, contributions from our technical advisor will likely reduce these costs.

This will provide quantitative and qualitative data on its potential for reducing the burden on emergency services, whilst providing a good user experience for care home staff and improving speed of access to medical care for patients. The technology development will be managed full time by the operations manager, and will be implemented in Bury Knowle Health Centre, where the co-founder is a GP. Phase 2 will involve implementing and improving our technology within a larger care home setting in collaboration with our care home partners.","Competitors fall into three categories: (1) Consumer mobile applications for video-based communication including Skype/Hangouts/Facetime.

Similar to Wordpress which empowers users to rapidly create a web presence without prior HTML/CSS experience, Bread Inc cloud based platform enables even a novice to rapidly design functioning electrical products. Bread Inc's innovation is timely as the growth of 3D printing and IoT is creating a massive renaissance in hardware (40x increase in VC investment since 2010). The underlying innovation within the Bread Inc software is a redefinition of the fundamental building block of a circuit. In contrast to the historic (and contemporary) circuit design at the component level, Bread Inc's software designs using ""functional modules"" - a collection of basic elements that collectively comprise an intuitive circuit function.","As product development consultants, Danny and Daniel were hired by companies of all size and stages to develop electronic prototypes with projects budgets up to $50,000. Several month development timeframes for base electronic design and MVP’s are widely accepted. Daniel and Danny believed that the timeline and the costs associated with these electronic development projects were not resonant with Lean MVP. Bread Inc. was formed to change that process from ground up.Daniel and Danny incorporated the company in October 2015. Since October, Bread Inc has been designing the Bread Inc Modular Design Suite. In parallel Bread Inc has been using their design suite to work directly with hardware startups to design the electronics to help them get to market.","Growth has proceeded along 3 axes: product development, early adoption of clients, and growth of team.As of 1 January 2016 Bread Inc achieved a Proof-of-Concept of their software design suite. The Proof-of-Concept contains: (1) minimum library of functional modules; (2) basic frontend UI/UX; (3) under-the-hood algorithms performing electronics design; and (4) backend data storage architecture.Bread Inc.’s team grew to a total of 8 with core industry skills, Marketing and Business acumen. Additionally, Bread Inc has the privilege of working with 5 Oxford MBA students to assist in critical early-stage strategy.In Q1, 2016 Bread Inc. has taken on 3 clients to further develop the product: Lifestyledesign, MotoCrane, and Healmet. The Q1 contracts from these clients total $100k revenue.","Our initial customers are U.S. and U.K. companies engaging in electronic and product design. Initially we will reach customers via word-of-mouth through our professional networks (through which we already acquired our first 3 clients), followed by targeted online marketing and also a possible investors network. Venture capital investment in hardware has increased by more than 40x since 2010, and was $8Bn in 2015 in the U.S.. The market for emerging hardware technology grew 242% in 2014 (to $5Bn). According to stats from TechCrunch, hardware startups alone spend ~$50k to get to DFM and ~$300k to perform their first factory run. According to Bolt Venture Corporation there are at least 2000 hardware startups in the US alone as of 2015.","NEAR TERM (present): We are currently charging customers on an individual basis for the manual development of their electronics design with support of our cloud-based software. That way we further develop our software and library with constant customer feedback. As soon as the software is finished we charge a subscription fee for usage.MID TERM (Q3 2016): For a fixed fee (+ cost of manufacturing) individual customers can design and order their circuit boards directly through bread-inc.com. For recurring users, a tiered monthly payment structure will be available.LONG TERM (Q3 2017): There is not space to discuss our long term revenue strategies, which we will happily discuss in person. ","We are seeking £ 25k investment which will be used to expand our engineering team. We are at a critical point where we have clients and revenue, but the demands on our engineering team are becoming infeasible. Our engineering team is, in parallel, developing our software design suite as well as developing electronics for our customers. Engineering services consulting is a means of field-testing our software design suite. However, with the escalating demands on our team, we can no longer support simultaneous product development and consulting. Thus we need to expand and split our team into two specialties: engineering services consulting, and product development. Capital from the Oxford Seed fund would be timely in this critical growth stage.","The business goals for Bread Inc in 2016 proceed along 4 axes - product development, obtaining clients, growth of team, and funding - Our product development goal is to launch our online software design suite by July 2016.- We intend to grow our team to 14 people (6 full time) by the end of 2016. We want to add a director of marketing, a director of sales, an embedded systems engineer, a UI/UX developer, and an electrical engineer. - We intend to maintain our product development consulting services and net at least $100k consulting revenue per quarter - After finishing the product and growing the team, we aim for a second round of investment by the end of 2016. ","Bread Inc's software defines the fundamental building block as the ""functional module"" - a collection of basic circuit elements that comprise an intuitive circuit function.

Feedr vets servings, quality and nutrition, helping companies find better options that suit preferences. A mix of human support and machine learning helps recommend menu combinations to meet group size, budget and dietary preferences. We help vendors grow their businesses by matching them with suitable companies and providing feedback data. Additionally, Feedr works with its network of caterers to facilitate coordinated charitable contributions ( the “give-share” program).","While working at Osper last summer, I observed the difficulties encountered when ordering office lunches.  After 3 months of research and testing (details below), I saw a large opportunity to connect the catering sector to offices via a curated platform. My mission is to make healthy, nourishing food accessible across all workplaces. Prior to Feedr, I launched a healthy snack brand (Viva Kale), and at PepsiCo I worked on innovation for an artisan product line. I have assembled a rockstar team that are excited about the problem.

The “buyer” in most cases is a PA or office manager. Our first market will be London. Central London has 25,000 companies with 5-250 employees. Assuming an average of 2 orders per week, each at £100, this is an addressable market segment of £250m in central London alone.  Following London, we would expand to other UK and International cities. To reach customers, we will initially use warm leads to get introduction to office managers (approx 40 already in pipeline). We will also a) implement a referral bonus as PAs are a connected community b) Offer perks for office admins to encourage registration c) create partnerships with service office companies, office space marketplaces like ‘Hubble’ and pop-up space marketplaces like ‘Appear Here’. ","Feedr takes 12.5% commission from each catering transaction, assuming vendors do their own delivery.  In version 2, Feedr will onboard additional restaurants and caterers without logistics, and charge a higher commission. In our base case forecasts, we initially assume we add only 5 new customers a month for the first 3 months. Then, after hiring 1 sales person, this ramps up to 15 each month for the next 6 months and then 20 a month afterwards (with a churn rate of 20%). Accordingly, Feedr will become profitable in 17 months. By the end of 2017, we estimate operating margin at 28% of net revenue (the total commission value Feedr gets). ","My cumulative net cashflow requirement for development, testing and beta launch is £55,000 (which covers team salaries, technology costs and some marketing expenses). I am seeking £25,000 from seed fund to contribute towards this requirement. The rest will be from personal savings and family and friends. This will help me to get a beta version of the product to market and cover all costs until a London launch in September, by which time I plan to have raised a larger seed round to fund the growth of the business. ","Our target is to sign up 115 customers in the first 12 months (0.5% of the central London market).

After testing the TrackApp prototype, and gaining important feedback from our target users, we secured $58,000 from FSD Uganda to run a heavy touch beta pilot of TrackApp which will launch in March with 200 entrepreneurs and the support of one financial institution who has agreed to incorporate TrackApp financial data into their lending processes. Our team in Uganda is currently four deep, and will grow to 12 by the end of the month, and we are closing a $25,000 friends, and family round in mid-February. We are also finalists for the Unreasonable Institute East Africa.","The 74% of the 450,000 Ugandan MSMEs who identify access and the cost of finance as their greatest constraints to growth. TrackApp will be distributed to Ugandan small business owners through a number of channels:1.	Partner financial institutions: Banks who incorporate TrackApp data into their lending processes will require loan applicants to use TrackApp for a minimum amount of time as part of their loan application2.	User referrals and TrackApp ambassadors: We know that Ugandan small business owners trust each other, and we will build a referral program to spread TrackApp through word-of-mouth3.	Directly through the technology: When an entrepreneur inputs an expense or income item, the transacting party is notified and invited to use TrackApp","Numida is exploring a number of way to generate revenues which include: -Selling raw TrackApp user data and corresponding alternative risk scores to lending institutions (about a known potential borrower) -Selling new leads to lending institutions (unknown TrackApp users and their risk score) -Selling TrackApp advanced features (export of financial statements, inventory management, audits) to the entrepreneur -Selling big data on African small businesses to interested parties","_£25,000 - Numida is a technology company, and we will use the majority of this funding to build our technology team. We need to hire at least two other local Uganda full-time developers to incorporate all of the user feedback we will be collecting during our pilot. This will be a game-changer for us as it will allow us in real-time to update TrackApp based on user feedback. Any remaining funds will be put into data science which will help us build our alternative credit-scoring algorithm that will enable local banks to better lend based on TrackApp data. Both of these are critical to getting to product-market fit, and that is Numida's primary goal in 2016.","In 2016 our primary goal is to get to product-market fit, and this will require continuous iteration on TrackApp.-we will have at least 500 weekly active TrackApp users, and at least 5 local Uganda banks will be incorporating TrackApp data into their lending processes. -at least 50 small-business loans will have been facilitated with the help of TrackApp data. -We will have generated our first revenue through data sales to banks. -Our team will grow to include at least two full-time Ugandan tech. developers, a full-time data scientist, a full-time TrackApp outreach team (user acquisition and support). Ben will also be working full-time on Numida as CTO. -We will be raising at least a $250,000 Series A round. ","Some major competitors include: -First Access (Tanzania): Numida focuses on working with small business owners while First Access facilitates individual microloans less than $1000 in size. We collect directly relevant financial data instead of arbitrary mobile phone data. Clients know exactly what data is being shared with financiers instead of authorizing access to all available phone and bank data. -InVenture (Kenya): Numida doesn’t lend directly to our users. We target businesses, not consumers. TrackApp data leads to better business operations for entrepreneurs. We only collect relevant transaction data with opt-in sharing of that data with financiers. Our data capture is targeted at larger and longer term loans (InVenture operates in the payday loan space - ~$100 repayable over 3 weeks).",25-74k GBP,Word of mouth - Saïd Business School student,"Numida is addressing the root cause of an enormous market failure that results in at least 22 million financially underserved African MSMEs - the lack of financial data on prospective small business borrowers. Although, there are several financial inclusion initiatives targeting micro-enterprises, TrackApp is focused on African small-businesses stuck in the financing missing-middle of $1000-$30000. TrackApp makes record-keeping easy and useful for entrepreneurs while providing data previously unavailable to banks to help them lend on better terms. Numida will incentivize good record-keeping habits amongst African small business owners by directly connecting them with banks that incorporate the data they enter in TrackApp (and eventually TrackApp credit scores) into their loan assessment processes.

Taking cues from AirBnB, we propose a model where the childcare-providers on our platform are stay-at-home parents who would be willing to care for someone elses child in addition to their own, in return for a small payment. ","The idea came from Aki's frustration about the situation surrounding women in Japan: it is difficult to continue their career after having children due to insufficient access to childcare. If they are not fortunate enough to find slots in public nurseries before their maternity leaves are over, they often have quit their job, as private childcare usually costs more than their base salary. Hearing this Stephan suggested that this is an awesome opportunity for someone to make an ""AirBnB for childcare”.We have worked on the idea since last december - and are the team to do this because of a mix of diverse backgrounds and a shared passion for moving the world forward with cool ideas.","1) We have refined the idea substantially, in cooperation with tutors and other advisors at SBS, as well as with other students.2) We have conducted significant open-source market research, identified the most promising target consumers, and are in the process of conducting a directed market survey with potential customers in Japan.3) We have identified that issues of trust and security are likely key for the business' success, and developed a number of different ways to solve these, as well as contacting experts on the subject.4) We have identified potential sources of sponsorship from the Japanese government, both financially and in promoting the platform.","11,3 million japanese women have exited the workforce for child-care reasons, and only 37% of Japanese children make use of public or private child care. The high cost of childcare is Japanese women’s greatest concern about having children.If 1/3 of stay-at-home mothers would want to go back to the workforce if they could find affordable childcare, this puts our market size at ca. 3.5 million customers. If we can capture 30USD per customer per month (see below), that amounts to a total potential addressable market worth 1,25bn USD per year.We will reach them by targeted online marketing, by reaching out via large employers who want to keep mothers in their workforce, and through the media.","We have looked at several different revenue models, of which a pay-via-platform system where we take a cut is the most promising.Assuming an average spend of 300 usd per month per customer (one child), a 10% cut would amount to 30 usd per month - recurring until the child is old enough to not use childcare anymore.As most costs will be fixed - i.e. administrative infrastructure of discretionary marketing, gross margin will be increasing with the number of customers.","25 000 GBP, spent as follows:3000 GBP - create a working online platform.5000 GBP - physical set-up costs in Tokyo, including screening and potentially training of childcare-providers17000 GBP - targeted online marketingWith these pieces in place, we will be able to launch the platform, begin generating revenue immediately, and start scaling up the business.","1) Prove the concept - this can potentially be done ""offline"" before a platform is fully developed.2) Begin scaling the business - our goal is 100 000 active users by christmas.","Certified nurseries (subsidised by government)-Relatively cheap, but limited supply and only open until 1700Private nurseries-Expensive, usually only open until 1700Private nanny agencies-Very expensive, but flexible - often used to take care of children between 1700 and end of workday (often much later)Other online platforms, f.ex Kidsline, care.com (when they enter Japan)-Similar to our model, but provides nannies rather than connecting parents with other parents.Our significant distinguishing feature is using a peer-to-peer model rather than an agency model.

Being particular about my shoes I wished I could ask people whether I should wear the new shoes, or my old tried and tested shoes to the club. I realised there was no way of doing this quickly and effectively. We are the right team to execute this because we are efficient, decisive and have every skill-set required covered between the three of us. What we lack in experience is more than made up for by our shareholders and advisors. We have been working on this project for four months and already have a version of the product on the market.","We are currently on the app and Play stores. We have had over 2500 downloads in 12 days and more than three quarters of the students at two secondary schools, Blundells and Wellington College have downloaded the app. Based upon these initial users, we are considering a number of changes in order to improve the product.","We are targeting the app at secondary schools for now, with a view to moving to Universities and Events in due course. The size of the UK secondary school market is 2,700,000 and university market is 2,299,355 in terms of the number of individuals. The value of this market is much larger and the difficulty of reaching this market with advertising makes Waggle-It an extremely attractive advertising tool. The valuation of comparable companies such as YikYak  ($400m) give some indication as to the size of the market.Ultimately, we are looking to expand into the US and Asian markets where the size of the market will be much larger.","we have three revenue streams: 1) Companies will pay to remove the anonymity and to reach target audiences. The app is usually totally anonymous so the benefits to businesses are: market research at a price way below that of companies such as Survey Monkey; users will be invested in the outcome and therefore more the company after having voted; and advertising to an elusive demographic.2) Companies will pay for the data which we will collect.3) Due to our very strong branding, one option which we are considering is selling merchandise. This is particularly lucrative at schools as the example of Blundells shows that people are willing to pay for the cult status that the app has gained there.","We are looking for the full £25,000 in order to employ our CTO full-time and pay the android developers to make the changes that we will require on a contract-b y-contract basis.

Our CTO values his services at £45,000 a year, an expectation which we are tempering with offers of conditional equity. The android development has thus far cost us £5200 with £1000 to be paid if/when we secure second round funding (>£50,000).
