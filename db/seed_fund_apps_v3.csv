Complimentary just launched for iPhone, and allows users to send compliments to friends in the Facebook network. It also allows users to view compliments and positive messages being shared near their geographic location. The app actively encourages positive communication and sharing to create a network marked by positivity.","Our idea is simple: social media is extremely popular, but too often is filled with cyberbullying, which most users do not want. For this reason, a social media platform both dedicated to combating cyberbulling and to creating a space for sharing kindness and positivity should strongly appeal to an enormous set of users.Despite their success, these apps are heavily stigmatized for offering platforms too easily conducive to cyberbullying. Nominally few gains have been made in developing platforms committed to social sharing that actively discourage and combat cyberbullying, in spite of the fact that the majority of social media users are actively against cyberbullying, Cyberbullying is the nontheless pervasive and more-or-less authorized by anonymous messaging, leading to strikingly bleak outcomes. Over 50% of young people report being cyberbullied. One in ten students as young as middle school age have been subjected to hate speech via social media. 95% of teens who witness other being cyberbullying report doing nothing to report it. As a result, social media self-perpetuates cyberbullying by giving users platforms for anonymous attacks where bullying goes unchecked (http://nobullying.com/cyber-bullying-statistics-2014/) However, these troubling statistics provide a significant insight into an untapped social media market: Given that the majority of social media users aim to avoid cyberbullies and refrain from cyberbullying themselves, an app actively committed to promoting positive communication and the avoidance of cyberbullying would be expected to gain greater traction among users than unrestricted anonymous messaging platforms like Yik Yak and Snapchat if it is also marketed in such a way that appeals to the same pool of users. Complimentary has been in development since December of 2014 and launched November 2015.","Complimentary's beta testing pilot, comprised of approximately thirty users, generated hundreds of compliments in a five-day period as well as thousands of app requests per day. Complimentary was just released for a public soft launch, in which we plan to grow the app actively in three locations: Silicon Valley, Oxford, UK, and Seattle, Washington. Each of these areas have demonstrable histories of rapid app growth and will provide key metrics about our primary audience of users.   (http://www.ncpc.org/resources/files/pdf/bullying/cyberbullying.pdf)","Anonymous messaging apps have tapped into a market worth upwards of 100 million pounds, with top-performing apps like Snapchat drawing 100 million daily users sharing nearly 10,000 photos per second. Technically simple messaging apps like Yik Yak and Whisper have attained valuations exceeding $200 million within only one year on the market.","At this moment, Complimentary is entirely free for users. Future routes to monetization could include ads and in-app purchases. Presently, Complimentary plans to remain ad-free, following the models of other successful social networking startups like Facebook, Twitter, Yik Yak, Snapchat, and Whisper which achieved extremely successful launches and first years in part because they offered free services to users. Collecting user data for targeted ads, as well as growing a large user base, will provide future opportunities for growth and monetization. These efforts, however, will need to be counterbalanced with Complimentary's commitment to privacy, secure communication, and the protection of anonymized user information. For this reason, our primary monetization approach will be ads and in-app purchases. As noted previously, the market for anonymous messaging apps is extremely healthy, with financial projections almost unanimously predicting extremely high levels of growth for mobile messaging apps (exceeding predictions for traditional social media). ","20,000 GBPFunding will be used for 1) technical updates 2) marketing and promotion. Complimentary needs initial momentum to catalyze rapid growth. The launch has already been successful, but to make Complimentary a truly competitive messaging app, we need funding to promote the app and target and recruit new users. Funding from the Seed Fund will take Complimentary to the next level, at which it is competitive with similar real-time messaging apps and capable of disrupting the current social media space.","1) Raise 35,000 GBP to grow Complimentary2) Acquire at least 50,000 users in three distinct geographic locations3) Respond to and release technical updates drawing on user feedback and satisfaction4) Expand our team to include team members dedicated to marketing and development","Complimentary competes with anonymous messaging apps like Yik Yak, Snapchat, and Whisper, but it should be distinguished from messaging apps like WhatsApp and iMessage, which fall into the category of text/sms-like apps. Complimentary offers a product distinct enough from Yik Yak, Snapchat, and Whisper (and in some manner directly opposed to these apps) that it should be able to both capture users of these apps and generate new pools of users aiming to avoid cyberbulling and negative effects from these apps. Direct competition from positive/anti-bullying social media apps is virtually nonexistent. The social messaging app Kindr allowed users to share compliments with others, but it is now virtually defunct. At the time of its launch, it generated publicity in Huffington Post and in a variety of outlets and gained users rapidly. The app ceased operations primarily because the founder shifted attention to a new project. Otherwise, positive social media remains an unexplored market primed for growth, and Complimentary's performance so far indicates that it is more than ready to take on the challenge in a market that could offer unprecedented growth.Given that the majority of social media users aim to avoid cyberbullies and refrain from cyberbullying themselves, we predict that Complimentary can gain greater traction among users than unrestricted anonymous messaging platforms like Yik Yak and Snapchat. Complimentary is an anonymous messaging app that leverages the unprecedented social connectivity rendered possible by social media for spreading positivity and kindness.The app also encourages users to intervene in stopping users from engaging in cyberbullying. Unlike Yik Yak and virtually all other anonymous apps, it allows users to instantly block abusive users from communicating with them. This is a data-driven decision drawn from the fact that 70% of adolescents and young adults report that blocking users is the most effective method they have used for combating instances of cyberbullying.",None,Sa¥d Business School website,,Melissa,Pip,Julie12/07/2015 - 08:27,86.172.57.149,Nick Housby,nicholas.housby@sbs.ox.ac.uk,7949244120,Co-founder,No,"I am currently spending at least two days per week on fundraising.The CEO, James Sharpe, will go full time when we complete our first fund-raise and I will go part time as executive Chairman.","The management team is strong _ Nick Housby has been involved as a founder and NED/advisor for several spin out companies and is the executive chairman of BioMimOx.

The main challenges of the biopharmaceutical industry are 1.	To increase the efficiency and 2.	Reduce the costs of the manufacturing process, with respect to the protein recovery, purity and efficacy. Downstream processing technologies associated with the protein therapeutics market make up around 80% of the total manufacturing costs of therapeutic proteins.  In fact, the cost of Protein A for mAb purification accounts for 35% of the total raw material costs for downstream processing.  Protein A resins cost around $12,000 - $15,000/litre, for a 10,000 litre batch of cell slurry, 10,000 litres of Protein A resin is required - $120-150 Million!  The resins can be regenerated and reused a limited number of times before the binding capacity drops off and the process becomes unacceptable for purification.  There are alternatives to Protein A, such as Protein G and Protein L (both similar to Protein A in their structure and function), which are slightly less expensive but suffer from a lower performance in terms of capacity and re-usability.  ","BioMimOx Ltd will adopt the following criteria into our business model and strategy.  The Directors believe this to be the most focussed approach delivering increasing capability in a managed and scalable manner.BioMimOx has proprietary technology with which it aims to exploit in a licensing and partnering business model. This is the simplest form of commercialisation for the Company which will lead to early revenue generation and profitability within a three year period. The company does not wish to seek to develop pharmaceutical drugs but to partner with existing players to develop early relationships with large pharmaceutical companies and smaller research SMEs. The key will be to get involvement at the earliest possible part of the drug development process in order to ïlock inÍ the BioMimOx technology. Regulatory bodies require that the drug submissions for development include tightly monitored processes. To get the technology locked in early means that a change to the protocol is difficult to achieve. ","BioMimOx are seeking £300,000 of equity funding in return for a 25% equity stake.  We realise that the seed fund will invest up to £25,000 which is nowhere near our target but, currently the company is in need for some funds to provide essential cash flow whilst we are completing our funding round.

William also felt the pain of not able to be there for his aging parents in time of need and was frustrated about the lack of knowledge of his parentsÍ wellbeing. When Joseph shared his idea in November 2015, William was immediately drawn to it.","Since November, much efforts have gone into building a team, researching various types of existing in-home senior care practices and developing a unique model that would work be acceptable in Confucian family context. With a prototype, we went to Korea and conducted a three-week market research which included surveys, interviews/consultation with nurses, social service/senior-care professionals, subject experts and potential clients including families with aging parents and organizations that currently offer various levels of senior care programs such as churches and local governments. With much more heightened understanding of problems and limitations of todayÍs senior care industry in Korea, we spent the past few weeks adjusting our business model and getting ready for the launch of our pilot planned for Q1/2016. ","Our target customers include senior citizens who are either independent or whose family-carers are too frequently away. We believe our model benefits most hyperaging Confucian societies experiencing low fertility and collapse of traditional family structure, such as Japan and China. However, in the near term, we are primarily targeting South KoreaÍs 6.5 million seniors (aged 65+), who currently make up roughly 14% of the total population. The market is growing at 3.3% per year and expected to reach 24% by 2030. Our goal is to work with local government agencies and senior care providers complementing existing services to registered seniors living in urban regions with dense senior population, and gradually expand our offerings to the general market in larger geographies.","There are two revenue models:Subscription _ Hyoson provides home visits - monthly, fortnightly, weekly - at monthly subscriptions priced at $50, $90 and $180, respectively. Each client is managed by a trained social worker, who coordinates each visit according to each clientÍs unique conditions. Weekly visit modules include sessions with personal trainer, nutritionist, registered nurse, concierge, etc. On-demand _ At the core, Hyoson is creating a local web of individuals who share the companyÍs vision to look after senior citizens. Qualified individuals, who are seeking flexible hours to make extra income, are connected via Hyoson platform and are called upon when non-subscribers have unexpected need. We expect 10-25% operating margin from each stream, similar to other on-demand businesses such as Uber.","We are seeking £25,000 for following uses:1.

It will facilitate diagnosis, monitoring, and prediction of gastrointestinal disorders, which are on the rise worldwide. Our pill-sized ingestible capsule, called Micropearl, will collect intestinal contents (including microbiome and metabolites) in a targeted manner with minimal inconvenience to users. Following retrieval, the sample can be easily extracted and analysed for downstream processing in a range of healthcare applications and microbiome research. It will, thus, provide an uncompromising alternative to currently available methods, such as endoscopy and faecal swabs, which represent a trade-off between accuracy and cost. ","BioMe Oxford Ltd was founded in May 2015; however, the team has worked on the development of Micropearl for 15 months. An unmet need for a more effective gut-sampling tool was first recognised by our CSO, Agnieszka Chomka, through her scientific work as an intestinal immunologist. The team has expertise in science, data analysis, business management, and finance, providing necessary skills to make our business venture successful. We further benefit from clinical and business expertise contributed by our advisory board. We received mentorship and funding during business competitions: we were finalists of OneStart 2015,  and we won the 4i competition hosted by the Oxford Entrepreneurs and Isis Innovation. Additionally, we secured £5k through an Innovate UK voucher.","We previously engaged a prototyping company, Triteq Ltd, to provide key design objectives and feasibility considerations for developing Micropearl. Based on the initial designs, we have since been working with the Medical Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC), part of the Innovate UK catapult services. Together with their engineers, we finalised a prototype design, identified manufacturing strategies and suppliers of key components. To decrease technical risk we have incorporated modularity into the choice of materials for each feature of the device as an integral part of the final design. The described work was funded by the winnings from business competitions and an Innovate UK voucher. We are currently engaging with investors and seeking non-dilutive grants to fund prototype development.","Insights generated through our market survey among gastroenterologists, and KOL interviews, allowed us to identify two key markets. First, we target the clinical research market within the pharmaceutical industry and academia. Projections based on the number of performed microbiome-related clinical trials indicate that we will capture 25% of the research market estimated at £4 million in 2018. During the second phase of our business model, we aim to target the multibillion-dollar healthcare market with private and public healthcare providers as primary customers. We currently operate as a virtual company and plan to outsource aspects of marketing, e.g. distribution of Micropearl. This will allow us to leverage the expertise of companies with mature product distribution channels in the US and Europe. ","Once the development of our prototype and a safety study (primo 2017) are completed, we will approach the clinical research community to establish partnerships, providing Micropearl at a discounted price, with data-sharing agreements for further product development.Based on conservative financial projections, we will be able to generate early revenue while continuously improving our product and establishing clinical utility; the clinical research market alone will ensure a positive NPV for our company. The results of our previously conducted market survey showed a strong demand for a device like ours, with half the customer segment willing to pay up to £50 per device, though manufacturing costs have been estimated to be less than £3 per unit.","We are seeking £25k from Seed Fund, which we require to reach the next milestones of prototype development through a partnership with engineers at the AMRC. Proceeds will be spent as follows: £5k for UK patent application (months 1-3); £10k on simulations for final adjustments to the current prototype design (months 0-1); and £10k on industrial 3D-printing of 1:1 scale alpha prototype devices (months 1-3). The latter will be critical for optimisation, demonstration of proof of principle, and patent applications to further de-risk our company for future investment. We are currently applying for an Innovate UK Smart 2015/16 grant, and proceeds from the Seed Fund can be leveraged to match funding for even a greater impact.","Prototype development, prototype testing, and patent application are the key milestones in 2016. Prototype development will be completed in partnership with engineers at the AMRC within 6 months once we secure funding. We will then test the prototype functionality in the following 6 months. We are currently in final discussions with an industry partner to secure lab space and in vitro systems that will allow us for a time-efficient testing phase. This will sufficiently de-risk the company to seek further investment for the human clinical trial to confirm safety. Additionally, in months 1-3, we are going to submit a patent application based on the IP strategy currently discussed with patent attorneys.","At present, faecal swabs and endoscopy are the main competitors. Faecal sampling, although cheap, is inaccurate due to environmental exposure of the sample and restricts sampling to the distal parts of the intestines. Endoscopy is associated with high costs and severe discomfort for the patient. Other emerging technologies include OriColTM by Origin Sciences and SmartCapsuleTM by Interface Therapeutics, which are still under development. However, both are confined in certain ways, i.e. OriColTM can sample only the rectum, and SmartCapsule» is based on high-end micro-electronics, making it too expensive for large-scale adoption.Our solution will provide an uncompromising alternative, creating value for customers due to its ability to sample targeted regions, high sampling accuracy, user-friendly application, and low price.",6-24k GBP,Word of mouth - non-Sa¥d Business School student,"Following negotiations with the technology transfer office at the University of Oxford, ISIS Innovation, our invention has been declared independent of the university; however, we maintain contact with Isis Innovation for support and advice in the development of our IP strategy. We are currently in the process of obtaining an advance assurance that the first tranche of funding will be SEIS-compliant, further incentivizing investment.

The long term aim is to sign up Aviva, Legal & General and Axa as enterprise customers for direct to consumer work. We have set up Google AdWords and the response has been positive; we are in the process of discussion with potential customer Swiss Life, one of the largest insurance companies in Europe. The size of the market is approximately £2bn per year, which is the total advertising spend on life insurance in the UK. Out of this £2bn, ca £200m is spent online, and we can expect this portion to grow significantly in the future. ","We are already making money by finding clients at a much lower cost than what our clients are willing to pay. If we can scale up and own the full sales funnel of life insurance, we will be able to source clients at a total conversion cost of £200, while insurance companies currently pay £2000. We can capture a big portion of this increased cost efficiency, for example by taking a commission on every sale of life insurance we enable. In the long term, we could even apply the same model to other financial products, as there will always be more efficiencies to be gained from digital advertising powered by predictive analytics.  ","We are seeking £20k which will last us until the summer, at which point we will raise angel investment. We will use it to scale up our existing ads that run on Facebook, build our first platform product and fund the acquisition of our first major insurance client. Part of the money will also be needed for the administrative costs of setting up the business, registering a limited company, setting up a virtual office address etc. The £20k are instrumental in getting us from a proof-of-concept stage where we are now, to a standalone company ready to fundraise.

Are there ways to assess and make a faster driver, using findings from neuroscience and psychiatry? Ovais spent time embedded in the race team, interviewing drivers, engineers, technicians, and then deployed spent a few races deploying these techniques, with great effect. It turned out that pro drivers, on average, only felt they were driving at their personal best around 30% of the time. In a world where milliseconds are important, it seemed strange that while every other part of the car was meant to run at 99%+, there was little science applied to the driver directly.

Compared to any other industry, professional motorsport has one of the highest R&D expenditures -running as high as 50% in Formula One. The absolute amounts that these entities spend on getting the competitive edge are huge. To give some examples:- In GP2, a team needs around £2m per annum just to fund a  driver. -  Nico Rosberg (F1) earns £14m per year, but per second of lap time improvement, he is still very cheap compared to getting the same improvement from an engine. ","The programme's benefits are hinged on a simple, manifest principle with high face value, such that it is almost impossible to ignore the urgent niche that the business uniquely occupies. In 20 seconds or less:Professional drivers report that they drive at their best, on average, only about 30%  of the time (n=18, Silverstone, Sep 2014). If an engineer made a moving part or ECU that only performed to spec 30% of the time, this would be unacceptable. Why has this been allowed to go on for the most important ECU of all- the driver? Neil and Ovais both assess and interprets team and driver technical issues, and present them to  each other. Together, the cognitive/scientific elements are extracted, targetted and translated into workable schemas for driver improvement. Programmes are invoiced for one year, up front, with a contingency payment due if the agreed outcomes are reached.  The programme is modular, each domain costing a base price of £24,000.

The focus is on the international student debt market in both US and UK, in general, represented by students from China and India (UNESCO Education). ","We will make money from origination fees (1% to 2% of the loan balance) and servicing fees (1% of the outstanding loan balance). The pricing strategy for 2016 is to penetrate the market quickly with a low price, starting with 1% origination fees. From 2017 we may start charging origination fees of up to 2%, and an interest rate margin of up to 1%.

People are more than willing to share.When I moved to London for work, I planned to participate in a popular short film competition. I had minimal budget and no fellow students around to borrow stuff from. I started looking for equipment renting sites and found that they charged a fortune. And that was the end of my career as a filmmaker.This was the moment when I felt a real articulated need for a platform like ShareClub and started thinking about how this could be done.									Fast-forward a few months - a friend from Oxford who had moved to a studio flat in Utrecht, Netherlands, was facing similar issues with getting cheap access to equipment. He was the trigger for us to put our ideas into action.		We are currently developing the MVP for the platform.

Cyclists no longer have to worry about getting lost or distracted on busy roads or have to retrieve their phone - a quick glance to Blubel on the handlebars will show the next turn and the direction of the final destination. Powered by its smartphone app, Blubel learns from other cyclists and suggests the fastest, safest and easiest routes. Blubel detects when the cyclist dings the bell in case of dangers such as roadworks, which routes the cyclist prefers and other data to improve its route calculation for the rest of the community. Think bicycle bell with Waze-like social navigation.","Cycling in London made me realise how much knowledge cyclists have about their known routes, and currently there is no easy way to share this information across the community, particularly in real time. The initial idea was to create an app that crowdsources routes and danger points, such as potholes, busy junctions, roadworks and other potential issues. I met Alessio in mid 2014 and we started prototyping. After testing the app we realised that another issue is phones are unsafe to use on the go. So we started working on the Blubel device in March 2015 to make an intuitive navigation interface for cyclists with easy data feedback mechanism for the community.","1) iOS and Android apps as per video illustrating the Blubel concept (https://goo.gl/pTzGg0). We will add additional features, however it is ready for launch as is.2) Built the hardware prototype (initially from Arduino components, and then through a bespoke board) and tested with users to refine navigation.3) Final product design: with funding from InnovateUK, we worked with a product team to design Blubel. We refined the bell attachment and other design elements with an industrial designer,  tested the design with several cyclists and conducted focus groups to refine functionality and features.4) Branding and marketing: we launched website and social media to build brand awareness, and are working with a PR freelancer to prepare the launch campaign.","We will reach cyclists through partnerships with major cycling accessories distributors and retailers (Wiggle, Halfords, Evans Cycles), gift stores and online retailers (such as Amazon).

We will also sell through own website generating higher margins. Cyclists purchasing new bikes: 3.6m bicycles were sold in the UK. If 10% of new bicycles are sold with Blubel, at retail price of £70, this results in revenues of over £25m. Taking into account Europe and the US - where total number of new bikes sold is 20m and 18m per year respectively, assuming a conservative 5% market penetration, this would generate revenues of £133m.","Sales of the Blubel device will be the primary source of revenues - currently estimate the price to be at £60-70, with wholesale price of £30-35. In addition, we will generate revenues through in-app purchases of the smartphone app. For instance, sales of curated cycling leisure rides for tourists visiting new cities by bike or fitness training guides.

It serves as a convenient intermediate between establishments and the general public. Targeted primarily at nightclubs, our service will allow for faster, more secure and more efficient retrieval of items. The main advantage for nightclubs will be a reallocation of the staff time currently spent on dealing with lost property enquiries- with many clubs manually documenting items manually and using this system to respond individually to the fifty plus lost property enquiries a week. The general public will have an easier and safer way of searching and retrieving their item.","LoFound was conceived at 5am in a damp and dreary kebab shop on New Years Day 2015 I had lost my jacket and was waiting until the nightclub next door closed in order to pester a begrudging bouncer about a one-man search party. The frustration of the night spilt into the oncoming days as telephone lines went unanswered and opening hours ignored.

We have a university ambassador scheme planned and ready to spread our service across the UK. We plan to have at least 150 monthly subscribing nightclubs by the end of 2016. There are around 1,700 nightclubs in the UK but we also intend on expanding to other venues such as theatres and cinemas, stadiums and concerts. High online traffic will allow us to expand extremely quickly. ","Establishments using our service will pay a monthly subscription fee around the price range of £40-80 (further market research required during the pilot scheme).

Hussain is part of the core team at Diligencia where he has worked for over three years, helping it to grow from a company of four into one with nearly forty employees, offices in three continents and a nearly four-fold increase in revenue. Hussain has first-hand experience of developing a startup and his time at Diligencia has introduced him to all aspects of management and prepared him to face early startup challenges. He also possesses an in-depth knowledge of the business and political environment of MENA. Kira Allmann (COO) is completing a doctorate in Oriental Studies at the University of Oxford, where her research focuses on social media and political resistance in Egypt. Originally from the United States, Kira holds a B.A. in Government and Linguistics from the College of William and Mary and came to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, completing an MPhil in Modern Middle Eastern Studies in 2012. She has spent over seven years researching and working in the Middle East, and she also brings experience in social media and web management, marketing and public relations.

It will match buyers with sellers and provide a secure space to communicate and conduct business-to-business e-commerce transactions. It will provide users in developed economies the ease of finding and connecting with their potential partners in MENA, bypassing trade mediators and consultants, eliminating the need to maintain a physical presence in the region and mitigating risk. MENA companies will have the unique opportunity to search, compare, and buy products directly from the source and avoid paying exorbitant tariffs to local agents. Taaruf will guarantee payment and meet usersÍ logistics and insurance needs. ","Taaruf grew out of HussainÍs experience at Diligencia, where he recognised that the demand for due diligence came from companies in developed economies for two main reasons: to guarantee payment and to acquire assurance that they are dealing with legitimate businesses. However, there was no unique online platform to conduct business-to-business transactions and perform essential credibility checks. Taaruf was conceived as a solution to all these challenges. Hussain shared the preliminary specs for Taaruf with Kira in summer of 2015, and they began collaborating on TaarufÍs brand and design. They are an ideal team to make Taaruf a reality because of their combined insights into MENA markets, their backgrounds which straddle industry, regional business practices, politics, and social media. ","We have incorporated a company in the UK by the name of Taaruf.com Ltd. and have acquired its domain. We have done necessary market research, and we have received validation of our business idea from experts, including an investment banker (Barclays), an international finance professional (EBRD), two Middle East political and business analysts (EBRD and Frontier Strategy Group), and a technology startup founder (Ingrain.io). The design of Taaruf, including the preliminary features for the product, are complete. We have hired an experienced technology team that will develop the platform and provide after-launch maintenance, and we are in final negotiations with a highly experienced technology professional, who will soon be joining as our CTO.","Our customers will be companies in developed economies and MENA that are already interested in international commerce. MENA region imports over US $300 Billion worth of goods each year from developed economies. Taaruf will particularly appeal to small- and medium-sized companies wanting to expand outside their domestic markets. We plan to introduce our product during the 2016 Middle East Ecommerce Show, and we are developing a digital marketing strategy. Both founders have professional contacts in the international trade sector and in the MENA region. We plan to directly market to companies and various international trade and government regulatory bodies such as the EU Commission, U.S. Department of Commerce, Dubai Department of Economic Development, and Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority. ","There will potentially be at least four revenue streams for Taaruf: 1) Transaction fees from e-commerce transactions 2) Revenue from advertisements3) Regular membership fees from all non-MENA users4) Fees from third parties, such as shipping and insurance providers ","We are seeking GBP 25,000 from the Seed Fund. The primary use of the funds will go towards building the online platform which is going to cost between USD 18,000 to USD 22,000 (GBP 12,185 to 15,320 approx.). GBP 250 will be spent towards the design of TaarufÍs logo. GBP 2,500 to 3,500 will be spent on participation in the 2016 Middle East Ecommerce Show. The remaining GBP 11,000 will be spent on marketing and platform testing and development. This funding will provide the essential financial spark to get full development of the platform started.","Our key targets are to launch Taaruf.com, test and improve the platform and to target the first 100 users, at least a quarter of which should come from the MENA region. We will also be working to actively partner with shipping providers, such as Aramex, and insurance companies, such as Euler-Hermes, in order to have these basic services available on the Taaruf platform. Because Taaruf will provide an online space to build a B2B community and also to verify company information. Product development, piloting and testing will form a significant part of the business plan for the next year.

There are MENA business information providers, such as Diligencia and Zawya, but no company is providing B2B e-commerce solutions for the region. Souq.com, Amazon, and eBay cater to the B2C and peer-to-peer e-commerce markets but they do not specialise in B2B sector. Alibaba provides B2C, peer-to-peer and B2B services for China. In this environment, Taaruf will be a pioneer for B2B e-commerce in MENA and will have a head-start on any potential competitors because it will not only provide a unique platform for building these relationships but will also address some of the key challenges to conducting business in the region, including risk management and monitoring, head-on.",None,Email - other,"Taaruf means ïto introduce,Í and it comes from a root meaning ïto know.Í The concept for this company centers on knowledge: creating a virtual space where companies can meet and feel confident in the transparency and ease of the business relationships they build there.

Tomatoes, for example, often perish after harvest due to the lack of means to preserve or process them into shelf-stable goods. As a result, processed foods are typically imported even when the raw ingredients are produced locally.Sierra Leone produces about 20,000 tonnes of tomatoes annually, but imports tomato paste, an ingredient of the local stable dish. Our company will produce canned tomato paste to replace these imports with a local product. By buying from smallholder farmers, we provide an incentive to increase production, contribute to the farmersÍ income, and localise more of the value chain for a product that is already used domestically. ","Mama Tamatis has been launched prior to the MBA by Songqiao Yao, with colleagues from Cambridge University with shared interests in agriculture, food security and development. In addition to successfully raising grant funding from Smart Villages and Unlimited UK for the project, the team has established a partnership Mountain Lion Agriculture, Sierra Leone's largest rice processor (http://mlbr.org/), to conduct a pilot project with their small holder farmers. The team has a diverse background, with expertise in agriculture, finance, business and law. Through their networks at Cambridge and Oxford, its members have access to relevant resources, latest research and best practices. A team has been formed to advance Mama Tamatis during the Entrepreneurship Project of Sa¥d Business SchoolÍs MBA program. ","We have travelled to Sierra Leone to research the value chain, develop partnerships, and plan our processing facility. Further, we tapped into the knowledge and experience of entrepreneurs who have successfully started and managed companies working with smallholder farmers in West Africa. With regards to the Entrepreneurship Project at Sa¥d Business School, we have recruited Julian Cottee, a researcher at the Environmental Change Institute as an Oxford Collaborator.","Sierra Leone has a population of more than 6 million people. Tomatoes form an important part of the local cuisine and tomato paste is used an ingredient to make sauces that are then consumed with rice. Jallof rice, a popular rice dish prepared across West Africa is cooked primarily with a tomato based paste and is a common evening meal for families. The market for tomatoes is growing and is quite sizable with the average family in Sierra Leone spending a considerable percentage of its income on staples like tomato paste. ","Sale of tomato paste in the Sierra Leonean market. Given relatively simple processing facilities and an existing local demand, we believe that the local production and sale of tomato paste is financially sustainable.","MamaÍs Tomatis Ltd. requires an investment of 25,000 USD and will be net present value (NPV) positive in three years. Revenues will come from selling tomato paste in cans of 70g, the standard for preparing staple dishes in Sierra Leone. The 70g can of tomato paste is currently sold for 0.20 USD (870 SLL). Our business model is focused in strengthening the local economy by sourcing tomatoes and labour locally and only selling to the home market. In addition, we will work with farmers to increase the average yield of tomatoes from 9 tonnes per hectare to 11 tonnes per hectare over the first four years of the project. After an initial assessment with agriculture business leaders from Sierra Leone, we anticipate strong local support for our product and the project.","We will secure relationships with farmers, set up our processing facility, and distribution channels to process 27 tonnes of tomatoes and realize £35,000 GBP in revenue in the first year based on projections.",Our major competitors are foreign processors who export canned tomato paste to Sierra Leone. Mama Tamatis will differentiate by targeting the tastes of the local market with a local product.

Today these use arcane metrics of ISO, f-stops, and fractions of a second. Understanding them is a barrier to most people enjoying their camera.By contrast, Expodo uses a simple, intuitive visual interface, enabling beginners to gain full control in minutes, through play not through textbooks.In the camera market no one has yet made manual control intuitive.In the smartphone market no one has yet enabled full camera control with an intuitive user interface.Expodo cracks both challenges.","Expodo Ltd is newly incorporated.In 2013 Tim decided to understand the manual controls on his camera and in the process invented a better user interface.In the history of photography there has never before been a single visual device that explains and controls all the essential ingredients of photography.

Basically, the concept is to partner with the local museums to deliver a programme for older people with permanent disabilities, which is similar to some existing educational programmes, including programmes for families and school children.

Her latest position was a Country Director in a regional education reforming project funded by USAID. Antonia has a real passion for children's education and truly believes in equal educational opportunities.The key competitive advantages of Oxford Study Limited are cultural understanding, professional expertise and personalised service of Dr. Antonina Santalova. Having been raised in the post-soviet state with professional experience in its educational system, she is in a strategic position to bridge the educational and cultural divide encountered by many Central Asian and Eastern European parents who want to have their children educated in the U.K. Dr. Santalova continues teaching Social Policy paper at the University of Oxford for undergraduate students of PPE, History and Natural Science departments. ",,University of Oxford alumnus/a,,Social Sciences,,Oxford Study Ltd.,oxfordstudy.org,"Oxford Study Limited is a start-up business located in Oxford, UK, specializing in comprehensive educational consulting, placement and monitoring services to parents from Central Asia and Eastern Europe who are seeking to gain the best possible higher education for their children in the U.K.  Although the provision of educational placement services is not a new idea, Oxford Study would be distinguished from existing efforts by both its focus on an underserved geographic region and its comprehensive culturally sensitive design. Importantly, the service will actively engage linguistically and culturally with parents and will be tailored to their childrenÍs educational and social needs. There are five primary types of services to be provided by Oxford Study: -	Academic assessment -	Research on educational institutions-	Supervised preparation for entrance exams-	Applications review and submission.-	Monitoring of progress and periodic visits to students","This business idea began to germinate in 2010, when I started studying characteristics of education in the post-soviet states of Central Asia for my doctoral thesis. In my contacts throughout the region it was clear that a degree obtained from a Western University carried considerable weight in the eyes of local firms and governmental bodies _ much more than that of any local university. I launched a pilot effort to obtain information on what services are needed for people seeking education for their children in the UK. Then the pilot project had rather an exploratory nature. However, pilot results showed that the offer of high quality consultancy for overseas children 15-18 years old seeking education in the UK was scarce.","As with many start-ups, the greatest challenge of the first year involves gaining access to the relevant market and building networks for the distribution of services. In this regard, I have signed Cooperative Agreements with Virtual Standard Ltd on promoting Oxford Study services in Russian Federation (contract is available by request). I also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Oxbridge Education Network (Reg.N 08394108) on sharing the client bases (MoU available by request). And I have registered and am in the process of developing online marketing, as noted below. I have managed to secure financing of the start-up costs and initial operating costs for Oxford Study at my personal savings expense.","Oxford StudyÍs mission is to develop a boutique model of educational consulting and placement services catering to the special needs of the growing professional class of Central Asian and Eastern European families seeking secure the best possible education for their children in the UK. Statistics on the number of potential clients in the post-soviet states of Eastern Europe and Central Asia i.e. parents willing and financially capable to seek higher education for their children in the UK is absent. According to the Independent Schools CouncilÍs Census 2014, overseas pupils make up 4.8% of the total 24,391 non-British students in the private schools. Accumulatively, about 3,000 students from the post-soviet states (incl. Ukraine, Belorussia and Central Asia) study at independent schools/colleges in the UK. This population is growing steadily.","On average the cost of Senior and Sixth-form education (from 14/15 years old to 18+) will make £70-100,000 based on the statistics of Independent Schools Council.  Oxford Study services will be priced competitively with other small consulting firms, which are much lower than those charged by the large firms due to lower overhead costs. Oxford StudyÍs fees will average £50.00 per hour vs £180.00 per hour charged by Good Schools Survey.  In addition to the low estimated price, most of our specific services will be provided using on-line technologies such as skype and webinar platforms and hence reducing costs on transportation and accommodation in the UK.  Thus, parents will save significantly having preferred Oxford StudyÍs consultation/coaching to a Six-form college.","Based on the average empirical indicators of advertising effectiveness in VKontakte (Facebook alternative for Russian-speaking population), we can calculate the cost of transition to a landing page and a potential client. Initial calculations show that the cost pre click on ad posted in Vkontakte is approximately £1. According to statistics the number of clients constitute about 2 per cent of the number of total clicks made. This makes the price per client about ~£50. Thus, with a plan to attract 56-60 customers in year one demands £3000 on advertisement and service promotion in social media. We seek £3000 from Seed Fund as this will be the catalyst for Oxford Study to turn into a 'full body' enterprise with 56 customers and 3 members of full-time staff.","My primary objectives over the next year are to:1. Generate up to 56 clients, engaging with parents and providing comprehensive high quality service tailored to the needs of students seeking to enrol in higher education programs in the U.K.;2. Establish three full-time job places for team members; 3. Generate a net profit of £22,000 by developing an initial client base and keeping overhead costs to a minimum.","Outside the UK, educational consulting services were taken on by firms organized with a core business model similar to travel agencies, similar to that of Thomas Cook or Thompson. Those pay no attention to studentsÍ specific needs or charge enormous fees (e.g. Carfax). The best of these businesses are of British origin e.g. Education Advisers Ltd and Good Schools Survey Advisors. However, Oxford Study has advantages:  a) the geographic concentration on Central Asia and Eastern Europe; b) the director of Oxford StudyÍs linguistic fluency, cultural skills and educational experience related to this region; and c) the individually tailored package of services offered to students and their families.",None,Word of mouth - Sa¥d Business School student,"Universities in the UK contribute more than £7 billion to the UK economy. The Public Policy Research Institute raised a concern that the UK higher education sector as a whole has experienced two consecutive years of falling overseas entrants, in both 2011_12 and 2012_13. In this light, Oxford StudyÍs business appears to be beneficial for the UK in the following respects:1.	Increased revenue of the state budget through taxes paid-in;2.	Improved employment rate in the country through established job places sensitive to the graduatesÍ needs in flexible working hours;3.	Boosting competitive edge of the British education and economy by attracting highly skilled and talented students from abroad.",Pip,Julie,Peter
